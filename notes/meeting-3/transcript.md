# Meeting Transcript, Meeting 3

## AI Summary
The discussion revolves around various themes, drawing inspiration from Hegelian philosophy. Hegel's distinction between the history of science and the history of law is explored. It is noted that while the history of science involves radical shifts in paradigms and transformations in objects of study, the history of law remains relatively stable. This distinction highlights the fundamental differences between science and philosophy, as Hegel argues that science deals with the objective world, whereas philosophy (represented by the history of law) explores the subjective realm of human consciousness and its relationship to societal structures.

Furthermore, the conversation delves into Hegel's concept of self-realization and the notion of spirit emptying itself into time. The idea of incarnation, where God becomes matter, is discussed in relation to Hegel's philosophy. It is emphasized that in Christianity, the incarnation reveals that matter is already imbued with spirit, challenging the perception of matter as a mere physical substance. This concept aligns with Hegel's idea of self-sacrifice, where true self-realization requires relinquishing individual existence and recognizing the interconnectedness of spirit and matter.

The dialogue also touches upon Hegel's philosophy of knowledge and self-reflection. The transformative power of knowledge is highlighted, as Hegel posits that true knowledge involves a process of self-recognition and self-consciousness. This idea is expressed through the concept of knowledge as a new existence and a new shape of spirit. Hegel's notion of the dialectic is implied, suggesting that knowledge is attained through the synthesis of opposing elements, such as the subjective and objective, or the abstract and concrete.

Furthermore, the critique of contemporary society's materialistic tendencies aligns with Hegel's concern about the loss of self-knowledge and the prioritization of immediate gratification. Hegel believed that a deeper understanding of oneself and the world required a reflective and critical examination of societal values and norms. The conversation emphasizes the need to overcome the superficial pursuit of materialistic goals and embrace a broader perspective that includes spiritual and philosophical dimensions.

In summary, the discussion weaves together Hegelian concepts such as the distinction between the history of science and the history of law, the idea of spirit emptying itself into time, the role of incarnation and self-sacrifice in self-realization, the transformative power of knowledge and self-reflection, and the critique of contemporary materialistic society. These themes reflect Hegel's philosophy and his exploration of the relationship between consciousness, history, and the development of self-understanding.

**Questions and Answers**

Question: "What was I saying about history of science?" (Participant 1)
Answer: The history of science involves radical shifts in paradigms and transformations in objects of study. It is distinct from the history of law, which remains relatively stable.

Question: "Do you need to know the history of science to do science?" (Participant 1)
Answer: No, the history of science is not necessary to actively engage in scientific pursuits. Unlike the history of law, which is considered essential for understanding legal systems, the history of science is not a prerequisite for scientific inquiry.

Question: "Is the object in science fundamentally different from the object in philosophy?" (Participant 1)
Answer: The objects in science undergo radical shifts and paradigm changes, while the objects in philosophy, particularly in the history of law, remain more constant. This difference suggests that science and philosophy are distinct disciplines.

Question: "What can be said about the materialist perspective?" (Participant 2)
Answer: The materialist perspective acknowledges that different objects of consciousness have different forms, but it posits that these objects are constituted by a fundamental material reality. However, it is argued that matter itself is an abstraction, and the notion of matter is challenged as a pure abstraction.

Question: "What does science talk about if not matter?" (Participant 2)
Answer: Science does not primarily focus on matter but instead explores concepts like energy, mass, and the interplay between various phenomena. Matter itself is understood as a complex composition of empty space, waves of probabilities, and other elements.

Question: "Where does science start?" (Participant 2)
Answer: Science as a dedicated field of study began in the twelfth century with the establishment of universities focused on studying the universe. This marked a shift in recognizing the universe as an intelligible entity created by spirit.

Question: "What is the relationship between Christianity and the perception of matter?" (Participant 2)
Answer: In Christianity, the concept of incarnation suggests that God becomes matter, revealing that matter is already infused with spirit. This challenges the idea of matter as a purely physical substance and highlights the inherent intelligence of the world.

Question: "How does self-realization relate to matter and spirit?" (Participant 2)
Answer: Self-realization requires recognizing the interconnectedness of spirit and matter. It involves letting go of individual existence, embracing the interconnected nature of consciousness and societal structures, and realizing that true knowledge comes from self-reflection and an understanding of the world's philosophical and spiritual dimensions.

Question: "What is the significance of spirit emptying itself into time?" (Participant 2)
Answer: Spirit emptying itself into time reflects the process of self-realization and self-transformation. It involves the realization that the pursuit of knowledge and the understanding of one's substance require relinquishing individual existence, engaging in self-sacrifice, and recognizing the interplay between self-consciousness and the external world.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.710
iPhone: You say so.

2
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.739
iPhone: Okay. so how should we?

3
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.270
iPhone: This? well.

4
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.640
iPhone: so I, I started the the practice.

5
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.100
iPhone: Yeah. And we got like 20 to 30 paragraph soon. Okay? And then I find it very difficult.

6
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.780
iPhone: and so yeah, like, maybe. Yeah, how many paragraphs is the preface in total

7
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.740
iPhone: 7, 70.

8
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.950
iPhone: Yeah. So

9
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.430
iPhone: introduction.

10
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.260
iPhone: the introduction is into that introduction is

11
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.350
iPhone: more.

12
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.770
iPhone: It's it's still I go. But it's

13
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.840
iPhone: more

14
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.410
iPhone: directly and

15
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.799
iPhone: full stuff. You can just kind of more of an argument. Let's start when we get to the Internet. So there's the practice in those introduction.

16
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.910
iPhone: And

17
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.309
iPhone: hmm the introduction. So I believe if I would, my message to the introduction

18
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.960
iPhone: first. before he will not all after so like

19
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.400
iPhone: that you can see his mind just going.

20
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.360
iPhone: I'm set up this. This will be just finished in the premise. The introduction is actually more like an introduction, just like.

21
00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.490
iPhone: because, if you remember in the preface. He, he basically deconstructs the very idea.

22
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.540
iPhone: But in the introduction you actually kind of

23
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.420
iPhone: right, let's see.

24
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.699
iPhone: I mean, I guess it starts in deconstructing

25
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.239
iPhone: what we start dealing with.

26
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.700
iPhone: Let's see.

27
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.669
iPhone: yeah. So like,

28
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.449
iPhone: yeah. Anyway, I'm I'm just thinking ahead.

29
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.219
iPhone: The introduction is.

30
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.099
iPhone: yeah, it's a little bit, probably just a little bit more manual.

31
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.080
iPhone: but it also has a kind of clear.

32
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:57.880
iPhone: But anyway, so why, yeah, let's just let's just talk about the preface and see what we need at any moment. We can just kind of hmm next class or next session. We can just need to get

33
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.129
iPhone: introduction or whatever you know

34
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.210
iPhone: I have. I have some notes on office?

35
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.190
iPhone: Oh, I wasn't able to that as much as I could have. But

36
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.460
and so

37
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:18.520
iPhone: yeah, well, it's very. It's really systematic. It's all stuff that I referencing for myself. Oh, okay, but I I

38
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.280
iPhone: I have to say to talk about this. But you know. So I was saying, you, you said, do you want to start with some questions? Though.

40
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.850
iPhone: i guess,

41
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.249
iPhone: just for a birds of you so yeah, what is what is able trying to accomplish.

42
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.139
iPhone: Well, software in the breakfast. And then what are the steps that he

43
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.909
iPhone: sort of takes to get there?

44
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.899
iPhone: And then I guess from there we can then map them.

45
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.030
Awesome.

46
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.920
iPhone: Yeah.

47
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.649
iPhone:  that's challenging.

48
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.870
iPhone: It's kind of hard for me to see, like the

49
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.369
iPhone: yeah. See the

50
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.920
iPhone: this in the trees for the forest. Okay.

51
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.220
iPhone: it goes actually

52
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.480
iPhone: interesting thing.

53
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.770
iPhone: I guess you rights like it.

54
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.570
iPhone: And

55
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.049
iPhone: but okay, so let's see, I mean.

56
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:52.319
iPhone: he's essentially. Yeah, he's just trying to talk about what he's up to, what he's doing, and like his overarching  sort of kind of notions and principles that are going to guide, and

57
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.219
iPhone: and also anticipating and

58
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.440
iPhone: attempting to preempt

59
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.700
iPhone: some

60
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.460
iPhone: what you know you might call naive or

61
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.680
iPhone: inadequate interpretations both of philosopher, but also what he is doing. because he is

62
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.560
iPhone: proposing, at least for as far as he's concerned. And I would say, it's basically true what extent it's definitely a radical

63
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.720
iPhone:  a radical step here that he's trying to.

64
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.769
iPhone: He's just kind of putting on scene for the first time

65
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.530
iPhone: in the history of

66
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.980
iPhone: but

67
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.499
iPhone: that itself is.

68
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.120
iPhone: Yeah, I mean, that's that's like in its cell phone. It's a.

69
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.800
iPhone: it requires this kind of

70
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:57.830
iPhone: account of essentially yeah development mediation substation like those are all. What is it talking about here? And it's just kind of trying to tell you how this what this is, because.

71
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:05.709
iPhone:  you know the objective here. The objective

72
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.770
iPhone: is

73
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.560
iPhone: self knowledge, that it's spiritual and knowledge.

74
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.729
iPhone: and you, as you saw from like, you know.

75
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:27.680
iPhone: But as long as your philosophy, like the whole history of the cosmos, is directed towards that one object is to generate cell phones, so that spirit can be home at home with itself in this world.

76
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.380
iPhone: that is.

77
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:49.190
iPhone: but doesn't recognize itself in yet. And this is this, what Hegel is proposing to do is to show that that's what's happening because you need to realize that that's what's happening. Or to reach that final point of being at home in the world. Recognize to recognize recognition is also a big to recognize

78
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.580
iPhone: yourself in the world. As it is, you need to recognize that it is, in fact.

79
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.560
iPhone: the culmination of this

80
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:06.290
iPhone: process of development. But philosophy, then, is it kind of the culmination of the combination? Since that it's the

81
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.649
iPhone: philosophy of that

82
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.520
iPhone: spirit becomes objectified.

83
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.730
iPhone: What it is now, the thing is that

84
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.820
iPhone: so

85
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.339
take care.

86
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:43.630
iPhone:  right? Okay? So

87
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.059
iPhone: I mean.

88
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.969
iPhone: that's not really.

89
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.569
it's like.

90
00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:10.270
iPhone:  So yeah, yeah, so

91
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.010
iPhone: history.

92
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:23.340
iPhone: yeah. And  when you look at this

93
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.360
philosophy.

94
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.540
yes.

95
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.179
and

96
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.170
iPhone: and relate to that over there

97
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.539
that just

98
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.000
iPhone: it's just there.

99
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.569
iPhone: Okay, let's just say, and then what you see. Is that

100
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.040
iPhone: the way that that people then interpret

101
00:08:52.410 --> 00:09:00.230
iPhone: which these different? And then, once you know Arizona? He said this. and then.

102
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:05.010
iPhone:  you know, like, Oh, Cox, no, it's

103
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:12.289
iPhone: so Tyn, if you took his shot. But it was, you know, and then you look for arguments and like things to say like.

104
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.650
iPhone: Oh.

105
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:24.420
iPhone: but not the. And so it's like those are kind of merely. I mean, you can like you can talk about like influence or play with

106
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.000
iPhone:  and

107
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.760
iPhone: but not be able to see any of this

108
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.750
iPhone: process here a process in which the mind is actually coming to know itself.

109
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.250
iPhone: So what he, what he was saying is that these

110
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.400
iPhone:  These velocities represents

111
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.230
iPhone: different different stages. There are moments in history.

112
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.380
iPhone: you know. It's up now.

113
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.809
iPhone:  Here's the thing

114
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.640
iPhone: this is.

115
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.500
iPhone: they didn't have this term yet.

116
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.249
iPhone: Actually, I think maybe it was already around.

117
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.650
iPhone: I think it's getting.

118
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.880
iPhone: It doesn't matter.

119
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.460
iPhone: because, like I said, it really is. I know it's already in the

120
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.590
sure

121
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.920
iPhone: to the some sense that

122
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.160
iPhone: the

123
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.010
iPhone: well it

124
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.730
iPhone: that there. what I'm doing at here is

125
00:10:54.540 --> 00:11:05.400
iPhone:  in order to be able to.

126
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.779
iPhone: and not just

127
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.230
iPhone: that. So

128
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:26.280
iPhone: as if, like  

129
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.190
iPhone: anyway,

130
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:44.379
iPhone: unless you this is the this is where the

131
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.410
hmm!

132
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.299
iPhone: You cannot recognize.

133
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.840
please

134
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.880
iPhone: as your stages.

135
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.099
iPhone: Yeah, fold it up.

136
00:11:52.870 --> 00:12:04.579
iPhone: So, in other words, in order to profit at least the history of philosophy. that is, study such a way that it doesn't appear to be really sort of an external mutually exclusive positions.

137
00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.380
iPhone: but as actually known to the unfolding of $7

138
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.609
iPhone: spirit, the ongoing genesis for yourself you already have to know.

139
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.580
iPhone: The spirit is that's one of the it is very loss.

140
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.640
iPhone:  and

141
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.740
iPhone:  So what I'm saying is that

142
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:37.499
iPhone: what Hegel is trying to do with my knowledge? He is trying to help us get to this point where we can see this as this, not just as

143
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.910
iPhone: yeah. And

144
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:57.739
iPhone: because that's the thing. Is that not just when you talk about the all and object whatever they need. it can literally be the whole history of philosophy. You can treat as if it were

145
00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.010
iPhone: just

146
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.159
iPhone: a kind of happen stance over there.

147
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.470
iPhone: and not necessarily see see it as a product.

148
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.410
iPhone: Okay, this is the whole thing. You have a result, not

149
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.880
iPhone: my spirit is something

150
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:24.050
iPhone:  And so you. So we can be alienated from the

151
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.079
iPhone: not.

152
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.739
iPhone: And remember on to you capitulates by logic

153
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.429
iPhone: today. And here I'll show you. This is 1 one famous castle job

154
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:45.739
iPhone: tied down with

155
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.780
the text

156
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.790
iPhone: I was going to talk about.

157
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.529
iPhone: I go to

158
00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:02.310
iPhone:  26.

159
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:11.430
iPhone: Hmm. So this is a kind of a Danny's passage where.

160
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.469
iPhone: so it will says.

161
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.770
iPhone: actually these. So it's at the bottom of the that page about 8 14.

162
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.630
iPhone:  right

163
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:39.499
iPhone: like it, says the individual, has a right to demand that science should at least provide him a ladder to this stand. One should show him this standpoint in himself.

164
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.780
iPhone: which is to say.

165
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:50.040
iPhone: he's gonna give you a ladder. Now to get to the point where you reach a standpoint in which you

166
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.270
iPhone: can recognize the history of philosophy

167
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.660
iPhone: this way, because

168
00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.939
iPhone: most people don't reach that standpoint. And so they relate to the history of

169
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.880
iPhone: haphazard contingent succession of new to the exclusive.

170
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.700
iPhone: Everyone dies at the end.

171
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:15.409
iPhone: And so he said, yeah, we. So I need to help you reach that point.

172
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:21.219
iPhone: And there is a kind of paradox. It's a kind of but the only way, as he says I can't remember you.

173
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.670
iPhone: I was just reading this. But I

174
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.400
iPhone: there's no way around this. You just have to go through it.

175
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.890
iPhone: Is that it?

176
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.800
iPhone: The latter, you know, like they'll say, like.

177
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:36.390
iPhone: Oh, yeah, like one way he puts it is like the justification of what he's saying.

178
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.230
iPhone:  is

179
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.320
iPhone: what's the whole idea of an imminent justification like the

180
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:53.300
iPhone: The proof that this is what's what the mind is only happens in so far as you just go through the processes.

181
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.010
iPhone: You have to sort of endure the process itself.

182
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.560
iPhone: There's no like an external.

183
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.860
iPhone: You have to come to know your mind

184
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:15.009
iPhone: in order to appreciate this, but it's only in studying the history of philosophy that you come to know your mind.

185
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.579
iPhone: That's the paradox.

186
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.859
iPhone: and those that don't know their mind. But study the history of philosophy, they look at it as

187
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.290
iPhone: conjunction with these exclusionary positions.

188
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:36.400
iPhone: Hmm.

189
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:41.329
iPhone: so it's a it's like a spiral.

190
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.149
iPhone: That's the idea. At least

191
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:49.099
iPhone: it will be a spiral pretty sort of progressively returned in the beginning.

192
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.159
iPhone: as you go out.

193
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.109
iPhone: an account of difference.

194
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.929
iPhone: Only way to read the phone knowledge is to already have ready.

195
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.540
iPhone:  Now, that was kind of abstract. Because.

196
00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:19.050
iPhone: yeah, but I I I was just trying to sort of respond to this.

197
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.899
iPhone: Your question is, what what is the up

198
00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.590
iPhone: Well, that's that's the kind of the endpoint which is

199
00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:37.139
iPhone:  full self knowledge, which is aained only in so far as you can see, the history of philosophy at this

200
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.050
iPhone: this pattern, and then you know your mind. This is the mind

201
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:46.649
iPhone: sank. This is one. Okay, let me. Oh, yeah, sorry. It was like all these transition. Have them already to him.

202
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.489
iPhone: This, okay.

203
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:59.650
iPhone: here's one way to think about this.  in science

204
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.749
iPhone: for a scientist around here. you do not need.

205
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.199
iPhone: at least in principle, to study the history of science.

206
00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.900
iPhone: You start with the current science.

207
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.489
iPhone: Yeah. Yeah.

208
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:18.549
iPhone: because because the object, the science.

209
00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:23.030
iPhone: it's not the mind itself. Yes.

210
00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:35.190
iPhone: evolution. etc. And so Now. this is the thing is that

211
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.929
iPhone: that does have an issue.

212
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.780
iPhone: It does actually the the scientific object as such as it.

213
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:48.369
iPhone: which is, which is what we find in the first kind of real insight into that beyond

214
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:57.249
iPhone: handle would be something like where you see that actually, what was, he thought, was the object, actually

215
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.110
iPhone: the object? So what is what? What's happening here is that. okay, here's another.

216
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.940
iPhone: So what happens if you have.

217
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.870
And

218
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.010
iPhone: this is

219
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.770
iPhone: anyone anyone

220
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:24.250
iPhone: more? So

221
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.470
iPhone: okay

222
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:32.230
iPhone: and

223
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.679
iPhone: and

224
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.910
iPhone: and what happens is that. So as

225
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:58.719
iPhone: the understanding world is not the world of the time, they're different.

226
00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.709
iPhone: Okay, and

227
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.060
iPhone: which is

228
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:10.000
iPhone:  This is this is important because

229
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:19.220
iPhone: there can be a naive value, which is that. Well, no, there's just. There's just

230
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.870
iPhone: the object

231
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:30.140
iPhone: which is like the natural it. There's just being out rather than realizing that the very meeting of being

232
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.160
iPhone: objects truth, reality

233
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.650
iPhone: is fundamentally changes as consciousness changes its form.

234
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.160
iPhone: so

235
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.750
iPhone: the mind that anticipates

236
00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:47.909
iPhone: reality, and the way that the Newtonian sciences is a fundamentally different mind.

237
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:54.850
iPhone: and the one that the world as Einstein.

238
00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:01.970
iPhone: that that that object here is, be yellow.

239
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.800
iPhone: And

240
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.879
iPhone: so as forms of consciousness merge.

241
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.890
iPhone: They always have a

242
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.400
iPhone: and But

243
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:24.209
iPhone: you can. You can not fully enter into this process, since, including the idea of the gathers. Then there's the real audience.

244
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.509
iPhone: It's like that you start by.

245
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.839
iPhone: it's just kind of there.

246
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:38.239
iPhone: So reality kind of facilitates the minds.

247
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:45.920
iPhone:  I guess when the mine finally understand? So I'm like.

248
00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:53.370
iPhone:  Then there is

249
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.430
iPhone: no more reality.

250
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.810
iPhone: What do you mean that? What do you mean by a

251
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.589
iPhone: in the sense of the reality which

252
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.690
iPhone: internal object of the mine

253
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.360
iPhone: that never was.

254
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.380
iPhone: The only thing that was the

255
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:16.559
iPhone: yeah. That's all.

256
00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.600
iPhone: To think that there was something different

257
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.090
iPhone: is to

258
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:32.960
iPhone: it's it's still a positive and object. But then.

259
00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.680
iPhone: and because you don't know, you positive that's the point.

260
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.380
iPhone: there's been a positive.

261
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.179
iPhone: But if you don't

262
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:52.040
iPhone: recognize yourself in the object. You can think that the object was just there. Table will say this, we're over outbound

263
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.900
iPhone: this evening

264
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.820
iPhone: to the object of some big bound.

265
00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.139
iPhone: and you can treat the whole history of law school. It's just kind of there.

266
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.539
iPhone: Now, what I was saying about history of science is that

267
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:16.299
iPhone: that's a fundamental difference, that you don't need to go through the history of science in order to do science

268
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:25.520
iPhone: because the objects itself. Well, what who discovered is the object does undergo radically change

269
00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.370
iPhone: fundamental shifts in paradigms?

270
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:34.050
iPhone:  Still, the object itself is an

271
00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:35.540
iPhone: am I?

272
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:42.099
iPhone: Because the only way to where the mind reveals itself is actually.

273
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.590
iPhone: And so

274
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:57.379
iPhone: if you're pointing to, if you're going to a 10, not just knowledge of any old self knowledge you have to study the history of lost, whereas, in order to understand on physics, you do not have to understand the

275
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:08.880
iPhone: because the object is fundamentally different. Now I know it's of course, the object is the object. It's the mind itself that would have generated.

276
00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:19.069
iPhone: I'm studying, or yeah. but that's that's just to say that what science and philosophy are different.

277
00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.040
iPhone: what can I be like in a materialist? Say?

278
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:37.209
iPhone: Well, even if the forms of consciousness have right themselves for different objects.

279
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.909
iPhone: that those objects are themselves different

280
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.229
iPhone: perspectives or constitutions from a fundamental material reality.

281
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:55.880
iPhone: I'm not. And I don't know. That's it's not. It's not decisions at all. That's what he was going to point out. Okay, okay, what you can do is

282
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.790
iPhone: go back to Herstall. Okay?

283
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:04.020
iPhone: As you go from.

284
00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:12.269
iPhone: And then I just go down. take things away or like whatever. So the statue thing.

285
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:19.150
iPhone: Then he separated. Well, for it matter.

286
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:23.080
iPhone: And so the matter itself is bronze.

287
00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.420
iPhone: Okay.

288
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.330
iPhone: that so that that has its form.

289
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:32.900
iPhone: the material would be offered iron right?

290
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:42.780
iPhone: And then, of course, this is sort of all the 4 elements, right? But they're buying more. And then finally, you get to material for all this.

291
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.130
iPhone: Yeah. to the point. Here.

292
00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.520
iPhone: this is an abstraction.

293
00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.510
iPhone: It's it's this is the concrete thing.

294
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.380
iPhone: This is an abstraction. that's what one of the things they don't have is recognize.

295
00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.139
iPhone: Does that matter? As a matter?

296
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.310
iPhone: It's the most abstract. It's not the most concrete.

297
00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:06.870
Hmm.

298
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:16.449
iPhone: I like someone he's talking about, the

299
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:22.779
iPhone: not see anything in themselves, because you have to include actually everything.

300
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.900
iPhone: And so matter

301
00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.209
iPhone: matters of some abstraction.

302
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:38.899
iPhone: We know that from science what is what is matter?

303
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.809
iPhone: No one can touch or taste your or see it.

304
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.890
iPhone:  And more more precisely.

305
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.989
iPhone: I'm why I should. That is mass, right?

306
00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.180
iPhone: No, science doesn't talk about matter.

307
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:04.689
iPhone: There you I I defy you to find any advanced physics that talks about matter

308
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.319
iPhone: that is still a softball notion. It's an abstraction.

309
00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:16.540
iPhone: Science talks about things like mass equals. Mc squared is energy equals light times, mass

310
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.699
iPhone: or not. Max, not matter.

311
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:32.509
iPhone: Matter is completely what there's editing 2 tables that famously disabled this one thing that's in Pennsylvania will go off, but it's also mainly empty space, at the same time

312
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:38.110
iPhone: floating, filling waves of probabilities. Hmm.

313
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:48.380
iPhone:  And you can suffer the illusion. Oh, the real thing is this thing that I can touch, and that's the material. But then, even if you analyze what you're touching, that's just

314
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.390
iPhone:  The feeling of hardness.

315
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:57.949
iPhone: Matter is some is a notion that's just a pure abstraction.

316
00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:00.380
iPhone: Marx was just making it up.

317
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.730
iPhone: There's no such thing as matter.

318
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:11.780
iPhone: This is basic to anything. There is no such anything that exists as form

319
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.040
iPhone: integrated.

320
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.180
iPhone: So you have to make a yeah, yeah.

321
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:23.620
iPhone: you have to overcome the anticipation that being in

322
00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.780
iPhone: being?

323
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.590
iPhone: Yes.

324
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.040
iPhone: what do you mean? How did we get there?

325
00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:48.689
iPhone: I'm I'm just saying that. That's where, hey? It's okay. Yeah.

326
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:58.170
iPhone: But it's our insurance that science and all this gravity. No, it's not material.

327
00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:03.469
iPhone: Marx was confused. It it wasn't

328
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:14.389
iPhone: they thought the material, since they're being incentive, and they're basing themselves on. They're not dealing in these abstract ideas. Matter is an abstraction.

329
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.829
iPhone: We're dealing with a concrete. the actual human being, as

330
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.879
I can say.

331
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:31.690
iPhone: What is that? What is it. As it turns out. you never actually see me.

332
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:38.310
iPhone: you as you, you and your fullness our

333
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:51.899
iPhone: how do I know? How do I come to know you. I have to study all kinds of things.

334
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.530
iPhone: you and the and and Marx is just confused.

335
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:04.719
iPhone:  he's tracking sensuousness, as he says explicitly.

336
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.699
iPhone: So I'll be in the refer to the Centrist.

337
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.340
iPhone: He was just about

338
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.569
iPhone:  because you thought you were being rigorous.

339
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.730
iPhone: and

340
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.520
iPhone: when, in fact, we're dealing with purest of abstraction matter.

341
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:35.820
iPhone: Now you can talk about. Okay. He's got other things going on like the way

342
00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.670
iPhone: you know, because he's saying there's just labor.

343
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:45.740
iPhone: Okay, here's another way to. But there's another thing that's labor, right? Generating. It's up. Yeah.

344
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:50.349
iPhone: And then capital airlines. It's for me.

345
00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.939
iPhone:  But he doesn't talk about intellectually.

346
00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.310
iPhone: He doesn't understand it.

347
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:07.969
iPhone: The intellectual they were generating an object, and that you don't have history. You don't have the dialect of history without intelligence.

348
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.310
iPhone: The first of all, you don't have technology.

349
00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:17.080
iPhone: He just says, the material conditions produce the technology. No, they don't.

350
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:19.400
iPhone: Because

351
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:27.060
iPhone: you can have across cultures, exact same material conditions. And then also a new ideal.

352
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:28.410
Hmm.

353
00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:42.509
iPhone: that control that determines the material. Now and again the material that is always another way of realizing what what aerosol is, matter is always well, there's no such thing as just matter. This is a purely

354
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.180
iPhone: thought of that.

355
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:49.980
iPhone: The matter of a statute is copper and iron.

356
00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.100
iPhone: but that's always

357
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.100
iPhone: And so

358
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:17.220
iPhone:  anyway. So

359
00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.480
iPhone: or

360
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.340
iPhone: so kind of the point again, is that

361
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.439
iPhone: actually intelligence that transforms matter?

362
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:29.290
iPhone:  I see.

363
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.359
iPhone: So like concept in existence. Yeah.

364
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:43.039
iPhone: But at the same time, it's this is the weird thing that yeah. Of course, sometimes consciousness emerges out of pattern.

365
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:48.199
iPhone: But that's because it is already already.

366
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.910
Oh.

367
00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.020
iPhone: and then

368
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:08.450
iPhone: and that. But that's it. That's what he says. Matter is for that is not.

369
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.940
iPhone: it's not. It's not neutral.

370
00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:21.039
iPhone: Which is this is what I was saying to you know, it's also a bit abstract.

371
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.540
iPhone: like.

372
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:29.689
iPhone: yeah, I mean, I I can say more about that that is not no.

373
00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:36.330
iPhone: Is this related in your way to the substance subjects? Okay? So that, okay.

374
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:51.249
iPhone:  Laura, how you doing? I'm good. I'm just listening.

375
00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.599
iPhone: well, okay, so

376
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:54.930
iPhone: actually.

377
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.020
iPhone: let me before we go to that, let's do this.

378
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:02.349
iPhone: let me take you through a couple of sections.

379
00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:14.609
iPhone: So, Laura, we're gonna we go to. I'll just take you guys to a couple of sections here. So go to

380
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.020
starting.

381
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.599
iPhone: Okay? Actually, so we talked about this on on the

382
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:32.010
iPhone:  a discord thread. Yeah. And

383
00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:36.510
iPhone: so paragraph 8,

384
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.800
iPhone: and so, okay, the

385
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:45.670
iPhone: okay. And keeping with the demand

386
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:55.189
iPhone: with this demand. This is strenuous, almost over zealous and frenzy, effort to tear them away from their preoccupation with the sensuous, which is that into which Marks falls

387
00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.200
iPhone: is from Hegel's perspective.

388
00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:09.629
iPhone: from their ordinary private affairs, and direct their gaze to the stars, as if they have forgotten all that them buying, and already, like worms to get them. So the the mine had scared had to rest itself from this

389
00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:13.560
iPhone: being immersed in your mirror material.

390
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.350
iPhone: you know, even though it never really was that

391
00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:23.229
iPhone: Formerly they had to. They had a heaven and thorn with a basketball for thoughts, and even

392
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:28.909
iPhone: the meaning of all this. a lot of all that is hung on the thread of light by which it was linked to the heaven.

393
00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:37.939
iPhone: Instead of drawing in this world's presence, men look beyond following this threat to another worldly presence. Now, that's basic

394
00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:43.390
iPhone: Plato, Neo-platonism, Christianity. But other traditions as well.

395
00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:50.700
iPhone: is our astron. Yeah. For sure. any kind of like dualism in this role in the next world.

396
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.010
iPhone: which, in which being and truth and

397
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.800
iPhone: substance even, was located so kind of like

398
00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:05.349
iPhone: premodern as it is.  What do you

399
00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:11.160
iPhone:  kind of like?

400
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:23.910
iPhone: So like the philosophy of pay, it is almost well, no, that's the thing that philosophy of the in it paganism as paganism would be the immersion in the

401
00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.449
iPhone: So you have, like, you know.

402
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.810
iPhone: yeah. So you like

403
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:35.250
iPhone: the Dionysian frenzies where everyone gets drunk, and it's kind of

404
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.589
iPhone: giving way to their immediate centuries.

405
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:50.450
iPhone:  And so

406
00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.900
iPhone: so there was already spirit there in.

407
00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:57.870
iPhone: But it was too immersed

408
00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:02.610
iPhone: to most in this world merely

409
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:10.919
iPhone: And then you get the philosopher you get Plato. Keep and sorry to saying those, and if you famously solves Plato in the Academy. Same spirit is up there.

410
00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:15.710
iPhone: Hmm And So that's the no way to heaven.

411
00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:25.349
iPhone:  And the I. This year it had to be forcibly turned and held fast to the things of this world, so that we had to be brought back to this world.

412
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:30.469
iPhone: and it take a long time for the lucidity which only heavenly things used to have

413
00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.750
iPhone: to penetrate, the dullness and confusion in which the sense of worldly things.

414
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:43.730
iPhone: and so make attention to the here and now as such, attention to what has been called experience and interesting and valid enterprise.

415
00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:51.689
iPhone: Okay, which is modern science. Okay? And what we're saying in modern science and technology, and so on

416
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:59.130
iPhone:  and but it's also the background. Here is you.

417
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:04.099
iPhone: you know. Hango, he went to. He went to He studied that, as you know.

418
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:07.080
iPhone: geological

419
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:11.910
iPhone: it's a it's based on being trying to be a faster

420
00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:21.700
iPhone: it all because everyone was. If you're kind of lower middle class, and you weren't going to be a noble person like the only way to be gainful. And one other than just being a labor is going to the.

421
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.909
iPhone: So he and all his friends were

422
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:32.530
iPhone: training for this. So just beware everything. There's just a basic pushing elements back out of all this, even though he's

423
00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:45.940
iPhone: we'll repeatedly like I mean, Chris, most contemporary Christians in like a post. There's a whole thing about that. I want him to go into that. But what he, what he's getting on here is.

424
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.590
iPhone: and Christianity.

425
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:52.039
iPhone: You actually have the notion of incarnation

426
00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.460
iPhone: where dog comes down to the earth

427
00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:06.959
iPhone: and reveals that this earth does incarnate me. Right matter, and but spirit. It's the incarnation. God comes matter.

428
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:16.319
iPhone: but in and so doing reveals that matter is already in in some sense, and which is to say, it reveals that the world is intelligent, because in pantheism

429
00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.429
iPhone: the world is under the underlay by chaos.

430
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.870
iPhone: It's not intrinsically, it's not the. This is the world that spirit made.

431
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.380
iPhone: Okay? And

432
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.810
iPhone: it's also the dialect

433
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.880
iPhone: and and

434
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.920
iPhone: so

435
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.730
iPhone:  and

436
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:57.619
iPhone:  you can't use them.

437
00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.430
iPhone: It's not known to be created by intelligence.

438
00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.339
iPhone: so the world is

439
00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.969
iPhone: not considered to be intrinsically

440
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.320
iPhone: there are. and Ross

441
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.400
iPhone: comes in, and how it's UN if she flees

442
00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:29.629
iPhone: the spirit there. But it's it's not recognize that such I see.

443
00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.100
iPhone: Okay. And then, for then you have this kind of

444
00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:36.550
iPhone: heavenly.

445
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:45.639
iPhone: and what what he says that Christianity actually sort of well, but anyway, So what? And then what happens then is that

446
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.689
iPhone: with the Christian story and incarnation.

447
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.480
iPhone: Where did this? Where does science

448
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.489
iPhone: as it starts? Yeah.

449
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.359
iPhone: there. So

450
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.890
iPhone: not not twelfth century.

451
00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:20.929
iPhone: We're at the university starting. the dedicated to studying the universe this universe

452
00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.060
iPhone: 500 months.

453
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:27.730
iPhone: because they for the first time

454
00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:32.699
iPhone: they were told that this universe is, be intelligent.

455
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:38.350
iPhone:  And because, like, for example.

456
00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.009
iPhone:  they're still like they talk about our

457
00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.050
iPhone: starting science. It really wasn't.

458
00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.769
iPhone: for example, Aristotle thought that all of inventions that are in A

459
00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.269
iPhone: and the idea that you would work

460
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.360
iPhone: like study the details of what

461
00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:01.600
iPhone:  what we call matter, material existence

462
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:08.950
iPhone:  didn't really actually start to happen.

463
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:15.030
iPhone: Technology. In fact, one of the stories about this is that, yeah, that's one of the reasons why we have to

464
00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:20.280
iPhone: is that because of the.

465
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:25.839
iPhone: And so these months, they also had to figure out how to do they were saving.

466
00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:30.340
iPhone: It was called. They did 2 things, Aura, and

467
00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.180
iPhone: and they had to figure out what they were working

468
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:38.780
iPhone: they

469
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.059
iPhone: first year.

470
00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:46.500
iPhone: So you see the first windmills. the first water meals

471
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:54.570
iPhone: all coming out of the monsters. Okay, so that's what he's saying. There is that

472
00:42:54.990 --> 00:43:01.609
iPhone: But the problem is that now us post Christians become these materialistic. You know.

473
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.960
iPhone: people that are, too.

474
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:10.719
iPhone: Now we've all we're worried about is mastering little techniques to like satisfy our immediate urgent.

475
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.980
iPhone: even though we have this amazing science of acknowledgment.

476
00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:23.530
iPhone: Now, we need to be full. But that's like kind of a weird thing. It's almost he's like saying, now it's like back and forth. But I guess what he's saying is, there's been this final culmination where you like.

477
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:28.140
iPhone: You understand yourself the spirit, but spirit in the world.

478
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:34.270
iPhone: And so you don't just reduce yourself to the world. But you also don't see spirit as this, transcendent beyond

479
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:42.500
iPhone: the the word that in German is. it's the

480
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.450
iPhone: oh. but this side of the on your side.

481
00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.630
iPhone:  But

482
00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.160
iPhone: and so Hegel says that this is actually what

483
00:43:55.730 --> 00:44:01.380
iPhone: she, Jack says that with perjury the dog transcendence die.

484
00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.049
iPhone: Does God now is at home as well.

485
00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:12.660
iPhone: but as spirit. as intelligent.

486
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:14.969
iPhone: not as spirits

487
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.430
iPhone: that are just around that chaos.

488
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.070
iPhone: Okay, so that's that

489
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:29.100
iPhone: I was going to ask what what it was that force of we turned into

490
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:43.409
iPhone: the

491
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:46.030
iPhone: so the incarnation

492
00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:53.590
iPhone: in that very idea of like progress where this this world could progress because no one had a 98 progress

493
00:44:54.840 --> 00:45:00.250
iPhone: that the world can be made better through our interventions, through spirits intervention.

494
00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.869
iPhone: They didn't. You have a linear conception of time?

495
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.889
iPhone: It is a circular concept. If you go to any other tradition. Time is circuit

496
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:22.139
iPhone:  No, yeah. But but the thing is that Hegel thinks we should be.

497
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:26.430
iPhone: We should be post Christians. We should be like post post Christians and overcome our

498
00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:34.120
iPhone: this kind of weird materiality we fall into in our very scientific pursuit of domination of the earth.

499
00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.769
iPhone: So we need. As he says.

500
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:54.830
iPhone: the spirit shows itself as so impoverished. That is so now turned to the material that, like a wander in the desert, craving a mere mouthful of water, it seems to gray for its refreshing only the bare feeling of the divine in general. But to us, walking around and got down. Where's God

501
00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:56.630
iPhone: and all of this

502
00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:05.390
iPhone: but the little which now satisfies spirit we can measure by the little so like by our just being on our phones all day

503
00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.390
iPhone: watching Youtube. And that's satisfying us

504
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.700
iPhone: measures the extent of our lost

505
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:23.440
iPhone:  okay, so let's do a couple more.  yeah.

506
00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.109
iPhone: that's the

507
00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.180
let me see.

508
00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:43.759
iPhone: so is it. Is it that what's been lost in the creating from your mouth full of water

509
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.720
iPhone: is what's been lost. The

510
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:50.240
iPhone:  spirit has become

511
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.620
iPhone: satisfied with not progressing towards knowing itself.

512
00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.519
iPhone: We are kind of technical.

513
00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:10.629
iPhone: This is kind of a meta question, but throughout I I keep on wondering on what epistemic basis I go to

514
00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:16.899
iPhone: like? No, or on this

515
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:22.969
iPhone: I would say that. Well, what do you mean by

516
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:31.380
iPhone: one version of that same basis seems kind of sophisticated. Well, okay, so that's the thing that

517
00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:37.339
iPhone:  it can sound like, I said. It counts on the he is showing us right.

518
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:44.020
iPhone: But what's the alternative? Where you say? Well. there there seems to be only 2.

519
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:52.149
iPhone: One is the default. Delete is the of the individual ego

520
00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:56.519
iPhone: saying that you need to satisfy my criterion right now as I currently.

521
00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.000
iPhone: and that

522
00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:03.740
iPhone: yeah, everything, every point is equal, which is to say, minus the best.

523
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:14.149
iPhone: because there's only that's the thing is, it's like, Oh, yeah, I'm being democratic and equal about this. But actually, what you're saying is, well, mine is invested. If everyone is equal, then I'm the best.

524
00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.640
iPhone: I don't need to change

525
00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:21.040
iPhone: versus the other eliteism, which is

526
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.510
iPhone: the acceptance that you might be at the.

527
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:38.340
iPhone: So that's not really an answer to your question. Okay, what? What is this basis for planning all this stuff? Well, you have to go through it. We haven't even got an into it. Yeah, yeah.

529
00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.019
iPhone: And let me actually

530
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:56.970
iPhone: let me actually do one. I this, this will be good.

531
00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.380
iPhone: so paragraph 12.

532
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:05.080
iPhone: Okay? So

533
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:17.270
iPhone: actually, you can.

534
00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:32.689
iPhone: Okay, I actually go back to the bottom of page of paragraph 11.

535
00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:36.830
iPhone:  no, actually, it's just

536
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:42.409
iPhone: it's okay. So. Besides, it is not difficult to see that ours is a birth time

537
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.999
iPhone: and a period of transition to a new era.

538
00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:50.760
iPhone: We're still in that

539
00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.870
iPhone: eagle thought he brought it to a completion that has

540
00:49:55.330 --> 00:50:08.889
iPhone: yeah, like even like, certainly the French Revolution, you know. modern science, of course, to so seventeenth century into the nineteenth century which is writing. Yeah.

541
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:11.980
iPhone:  yeah.

542
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:27.359
iPhone: Spirit is broken with the world. It is hitherto inhabited and imagined as if and and is a mind to to merge it in the past, and then the labor of its own transformation. Spirit is indeed never at rest, but always engaged in moving forward.

543
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:29.589
iPhone: just as the first breath

544
00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:43.740
iPhone: drawn by a child after it's a long, quiet nourishment breaks the gradualness of merely quantitative growth. There's a qualitative leap in the child's school that's emerging from consciousness, something that even nature you see

545
00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:45.579
iPhone: to kind of.

546
00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:57.529
iPhone: So likewise the spirit in formation matures slowly, quietly into its new shape, dissolving bit by bit the structure of the previous world. Who's toddler? And stated only into that by isolated symptoms.

547
00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:05.319
iPhone: Here we're talking about, amongst other things, the breakdown of the feudal order, but also the breakdown of the

548
00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.240
iPhone: this is the thing about the Renaissance

549
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:14.289
iPhone: they often have. There's a kind of a mythology, but the Renaissance that it was rebirth of the ancient tradition.

550
00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:24.660
iPhone: There's a there's a contrary interpretation that it was the final coming of the

551
00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:29.890
iPhone: that's what the renaissance of the scientific revolution. They like go

552
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.280
iPhone: of that.

553
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:43.079
iPhone: And that happens slowly. It's these months doing this little thing. A lot of it was just copying stuff and just and the little brandy things. And this is why I, teacher hates these guys.

554
00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:58.740
iPhone: This. This is what Nietzsche says about the scientific spirit. It's the. It's because you have the scientists and scholars, too, that don't go out into the world, or like they're not Napoleon. They just sit in their rooms at night

555
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:02.860
iPhone: solve little problems. And

556
00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:06.249
iPhone: but what it all saying is that, yeah.

557
00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:18.440
iPhone: that slow process? Yeah. All these people, you know, in these universities now. So their little problem and you can see it. You can see the moments like, even just

558
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:20.579
iPhone: for the modern physics. Right? You had

559
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:27.389
iPhone: Copernicus doing his thing. And then we had Kepler and he had to go. Brah did all the

560
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:33.429
iPhone: oh, data. I'll

561
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:44.239
iPhone: the new synthesis. A new universe comes in the that goes back even further. You can see there was actually a moment in the fourteenth century where people were doing things like

562
00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.879
iPhone: most of the time, like

563
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:50.739
iPhone: they kind of have.

564
00:52:51.730 --> 00:53:01.179
iPhone: Almost they? They almost have the oh, yeah, theycartes. Important here. analytics, geometry and coordinate system by which you can start to map motion.

565
00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:07.430
iPhone:  so that was actually going back couple of 100 years and then and then

566
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:16.630
iPhone:  but of course it's a social thing happening, though the you know order is over. So it's a big, grand story

567
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:22.140
iPhone: like. So the feudal order is being overcome. This here it's coming into its own

568
00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:28.010
iPhone: coming down to earth and science, but also in politics. whereas in the feudal order

569
00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:33.790
iPhone: you had, it was still arguably to Platonic and Aristotle, and it's

570
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:45.390
iPhone: conception of the divine. But it was also the stratified system, where you have, like a a rigid hierarchy that culminated in not but that sustain the whole higher social order.

571
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:50.940
iPhone: so that all is getting broken down in the turn slowly now.

572
00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:55.309
iPhone: So that's the thing. We forget that there was actually this long process.

573
00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:57.320
iPhone: the gradual crumbling that left

574
00:53:57.350 --> 00:54:06.250
iPhone: unaltered. The face of the whole is cut short by assembly, which in one flash eliminates the features of the New World. They so this is Shakespeare

575
00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:08.100
iPhone: for a new world

576
00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:15.180
iPhone: that 6%. And it does with me in the.

577
00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:18.379
iPhone: You will tear it into a whole book on me.

578
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:21.690
iPhone: and he is also the father of the French Revolution.

579
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:35.989
iPhone: But this in the world is no more complete actuality than is a newborn child. It is essential to bear this in mind. It comes on the scene. This is what I wanted to do. It comes on the scene for the first time in. It's an easy, or it's not

580
00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:40.980
iPhone: just as little as a building is finished when its foundation has been laid.

581
00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:46.700
iPhone: My mission has been late, so little is the achieved notion of the whole. The whole itself.

582
00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:54.869
iPhone: When we wish to see an oak with this massive trunk and spreading freshly and foliage, they are not intent to be shown in acorn.

583
00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.050
iPhone: It's all Aristotle.

584
00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:00.040
iPhone: So to science.

585
00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:17.610
iPhone: Okay? But what I want to say, okay, so what I want to point out this is, this is kind of its own thing. But where he says, Okay. this new world is no more complete actuality than a new, more child is essential to the. It comes on the scene. That's a big, big phrase. There it comes on the scene.

586
00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.430
iPhone: This new world comes on the scene for the first time, and it's a

587
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:25.769
iPhone: what is being said, there.

588
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.680
iPhone: do you have her?

589
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.550
iPhone: And you got the part of this was a month, too.

590
00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:44.290
iPhone:  comes on the seat, but

591
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:50.620
iPhone: initially it comes on. and this is the things that this is happening all all time.

592
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:57.679
iPhone: We're doing this again and again, and we have these new objects that merge on the zoom. But in the first

593
00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:02.670
iPhone: we don't recognize that it's the product of a vast lady.

594
00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:11.529
iPhone: We just take it all this because it just flashes before us. Oh, there's there's the new 20 universe.

595
00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.969
iPhone: But it was actually generated by a whole vast labor intelligence.

596
00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:20.840
iPhone: Oh. okay, you're in where I'm saying is that

597
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:22.989
iPhone: there's a big word for you.

598
00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:28.040
iPhone: Yeah. isn't he? Which is a

599
00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:33.419
iPhone: here it goes to his labor.

600
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:37.850
iPhone: but it doesn't know that it's doing this. It protects its own labor

601
00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:40.720
iPhone: each time.

602
00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:49.189
iPhone: each time a new form of it. This the object is just there, that it gets its own like.

603
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:55.740
iPhone: So, by the way, this is this is basic.

604
00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:58.970
iPhone: So he's this is what children do all the time.

605
00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:03.589
iPhone: They will go through the staging development. And then, like, for example.

606
00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:06.850
iPhone: they won't be able to see that the glass.

607
00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:23.409
iPhone: You know that that 1, 2 glasses with the same. Okay? And then what they will see. Their object is that this has no water. Okay? And then they'll eventually get to a new object where they realize that it's the same because they have a new object which is called the conservation.

608
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:26.740
iPhone: but they won't know that they did that.

609
00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:31.450
iPhone: Yeah, we just have conservation now.

610
00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:37.130
iPhone: And the new and the scientists do this all the time

611
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:41.530
iPhone: like, oh, there's things, but they don't necessarily. In fact, this is famous line from

612
00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:48.159
iPhone: Einstein, he said. If you want to know what scientists are up to when they're doing science, they'll ask them

613
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:49.830
iPhone: watching. Thank you.

614
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:55.310
iPhone: The scientists are doing this, and then this object shows up for them, you know, right?

615
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:59.340
iPhone: But they're not. They don't know their own process of generating.

616
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.759
iPhone: because each new object shows up like a flash on the scene.

617
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:13.189
iPhone: and each time spirit or its own development, until finally.

618
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:14.920
iPhone: what you know you get recollection.

619
00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:19.080
iPhone: self knowledge.

620
00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:21.670
iPhone: you get it

621
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:27.150
one the thing.

622
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:40.009
iPhone: So in the

623
00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:48.030
iPhone: so not forgetting

624
00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:51.980
iPhone:  for the labor of the month.

625
00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:55.730
iPhone: Yes. so if you think she's the first

626
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:56.630
oh.

627
00:58:58.350 --> 00:58:59.400
iPhone: I mean.

628
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:03.050
iPhone: it kind of depends because there's recollection going on

629
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.309
iPhone: right so. But I don't know as this document. I much.

630
00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:16.880
iPhone: but I know I know it's out lower viewpoint. This is the no. I haven't been just talking about.

631
00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:20.770
iPhone: Okay, that

632
00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:23.579
iPhone: the mine just

633
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:28.650
iPhone: the forms are kind of over here.

634
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:32.370
iPhone: You kind of reach up to them.

635
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:35.660
iPhone: But they're not recognizing.

636
00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:38.050
Yeah.

637
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:41.080
iPhone: the kind of our is like the

638
00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:46.020
iPhone: you need that happens in the this isn't

639
00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:50.160
iPhone: what there's no history to. The.

640
00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:59.139
iPhone: This is the thing that's what I was saying about. Soon it's too busy. This is now we recognize this and everything. Now it's all history to the object.

641
01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:05.979
iPhone: But philosophy is the thing that studies that that history itself.

642
01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:13.619
iPhone: not the out. Just the object, of of course, because that's what philosoph, who isn't? He's a scientist, but he is what was a boss use.

643
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:24.220
iPhone: So yeah, our collection is the final moment where

644
01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:28.530
iPhone: you actually overcome your forgetting, you recognize that this whole thing was

645
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:32.100
iPhone: you generating this. Now this is.

646
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:33.490
iPhone: that's a

647
01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:41.799
iPhone: because in there was extension. They thought it was. And then, now, you guys

648
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.420
hmm!

649
01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.419
iPhone: It's always sounds like it makes more sense than I think it's

650
01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:00.769
iPhone: but

651
01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:11.800
iPhone: quantum mechanics when students are running.

652
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:20.310
iPhone: if they start asking questions about the

653
01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:27.170
iPhone: yeah, which is which is legitimate because they don't need to know that. Yeah.

654
01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:29.590
iPhone: unless they need

655
01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:31.520
watching himself.

656
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:37.140
iPhone: Yes.

658
01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:48.859
iPhone: so we can. We eventually get to the substance?

659
01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:51.350
iPhone: Oh, we can take a

660
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.109
iPhone: we'll know, for right now you want to do over an hour

661
01:01:54.300 --> 01:02:00.039
iPhone:  I was over today. But it, yeah, it's still, it's still in today. I'm saying.

662
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:10.100
iPhone:  yeah, okay, so

663
01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.579
iPhone: this is the last paragraph

664
01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.480
iPhone: actually, since we're starting to

665
01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:16.730
iPhone: at the end.

666
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:27.280
iPhone: this is the last. So because you're asking, where the hell is it going? Don't worry. It's getting diverse. But  just really need that. And I don't do that

667
01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:33.040
iPhone: right. In a way, it's sorry. It's the paragraph, anyway, it's just the the last paradigm.

668
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:37.830
iPhone: So you know where we're going? which one in the media.

669
01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:41.960
iPhone: anyway? Anyway?

670
01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:48.830
iPhone: Page page 492081 and 2

671
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:54.310
iPhone: so. But the other side of it's becoming. History

672
01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.100
iPhone: is a conscious self mediating process.

673
01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:07.769
iPhone:  spear emptied out into time. So that's what you realize is that actually, this whole thing is spirit emptying itself into time.

674
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:16.280
iPhone: this, this externalization, this canosis. By the way, you guys don't know this. That's that's what Paul says. Jesus does

675
01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:27.169
iPhone: Mps yourself instead of that's the whole thing, self sacrifice. So like you have to let yourself go completely

676
01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.600
iPhone: in order to recognize yourself.

677
01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.840
iPhone: is, it is equally an externalization of itself.

678
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:48.379
iPhone: The negative is the negative of self. This becoming presents a slow moving succession of spirits. That's that it forms a consciousness. Slowly session of forms of consciousness, a gallery of images.

679
01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:58.670
iPhone: each of which, endowed with all the riches of spirit, moves that slowly, just because the self has the has to penetrate and digest this entire wealth of its substance.

680
01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:04.250
iPhone: That's another way. The substance is already subject, but it hasn't become subject for it yet.

681
01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:10.520
iPhone: So it asked you. take itself. appropriate itself.

682
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.939
iPhone: and it's full well, it's

683
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:22.960
iPhone: this fulfillment consists, and perfectly knowing what it is and knowing it's substance, this knowledge is overthrown into itself.

684
01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:28.980
iPhone: in which it abandoned its outer existence, and gives it essential shape over to reflect the recollection

685
01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:39.799
iPhone: that's absorbed in itself. It is sunk in the night of its self consciousness, but in that night it vanishes out. Our existence is preserved and transformed.

686
01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:47.800
iPhone: and this transformed existence the formal one. But now we're born of the spirits. Knowledge is the new existence in New World, and a new shape of spirit.

687
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.229
iPhone: That's the

688
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.270
iPhone: come to know what cell phones process.

689
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:56.119
iPhone: What does it mean by my, my.

690
01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.729
iPhone: well, okay, so that's

691
01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:06.010
iPhone: is something in the night of self consciousness.

692
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:13.780
iPhone:  so it's not

693
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:18.710
iPhone: present to itself.

694
01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:28.760
So

695
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:39.969
iPhone: I'm sure he's gonna be able to tell us. But

696
01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:47.200
iPhone: she doesn't tell the last one it must then

697
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:51.370
iPhone: that is fair to in time.

698
01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:59.460
iPhone: But anyway, okay, that I can say more about that. Let's put it in

699
01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.550
iPhone: like 4

700
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:19.170
iPhone:  back to

701
01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:31.980
iPhone:  in the immediately of its new existence. The spirit has to start a threat to bring itself to maturity, as if now, part of what he's saying is that

702
01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:38.679
iPhone: we have maternity, that  With this new object.

703
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:42.399
iPhone: fully rationalized, scientific

704
01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:45.119
iPhone: and political world.

705
01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:48.689
iPhone: But it didn't know. That's that. That's what it was.

706
01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:53.579
iPhone: You just did it. Science just happened. The French Revolution just happened.

707
01:06:53.860 --> 01:07:02.009
iPhone: They did know themselves as doing this for the sake of these rational ideals, etc. But they didn't know that those rational ideas were the product of this history.

708
01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.579
iPhone: In fact, you can hear when they say they're just like

709
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:12.169
iPhone: The of the very nature of the French Revolution is to negate the past.

710
01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:19.290
iPhone:  By the way.

711
01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.129
iPhone: the Us. Is even worse. Us really is.

712
01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:30.079
iPhone: And he said, I think actually, spirit is going to the Americans going to America again his life

713
01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.020
iPhone: long story

714
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.410
iPhone: because we're the United States of amnesia.

715
01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:46.479
iPhone: But the but you guys not to Tocqueville. He was a famous nineteenth century, you know and volunteer on with book American Democracy in America.

716
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:55.290
iPhone: He says famously that the the method of the Americans is the the method of

717
01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.970
iPhone: you have to eliminate all influence in the past.

718
01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:02.419
iPhone: Just so it's it's it's day one every day they want

719
01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:07.620
iPhone: Whereas Hegel says, No, that's that's been peer negation in the past

720
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:11.889
iPhone: and the newness of majority.

721
01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:19.250
iPhone: So maternity is this state, this new first. So that's what he says. It's time of. It's an unsettled time. First on the scene.

722
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:20.730
iPhone: not his dad.

723
01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:26.859
iPhone: Sphere is now in the world. but we don't understand how this came to be.

724
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:30.350
iPhone: So you don't recognize it.

725
01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:48.160
iPhone:  so it's it's merely in the immediacy of it. Of this new existence the spirit has to start a fresh to bring itself to its maturity. So this new, this is the I'm saying, this French Revolution. But then there's an alien

726
01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:59.330
iPhone: knowledge of itself as such. All that proceeded were lost, and had learned nothing from the experience of the earlier. That's what the French Revolution are you?

727
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:08.650
iPhone: The recollection? The Imran is memorizing of that experience as preserved it, and then as it. And is this inner being.

728
01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:11.540
iPhone: and in fact the higher form of the substance.

729
01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:21.200
iPhone: So, although the spirit starts to fresh, and apparently from its own resources to bring about itself to maturity is nonetheless on a higher level than it starts. The realm of spirits.

730
01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:30.719
iPhone: that is, forms of consciousness, which is formed in this way, and the outer world constitutes the session. In time, the various philosophies in which one spirit revealed itself.

731
01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.010
iPhone: We build another

732
01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:44.429
iPhone: relieved another, sorry of its chart, so it's charged in each tip over the. So this one spirit within the empire of the world. From this process, with this their goal is the revelation of the depthy spirit.

733
01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.619
iPhone: This is the absolute notion of the absolute concept.

734
01:09:47.819 --> 01:09:52.070
iPhone: This revelation is therefore the raising up the

735
01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:59.179
iPhone: of it step. or it's extension. the negativity of the withdrawn. I. We haven't gotten into the whole I business yet.

736
01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:05.780
iPhone: A negativity which is externalization or its substance. And this revelation is also the notions time

737
01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:10.390
iPhone: that it's external. I guess the the goal after the

738
01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:17.539
iPhone: reservation regard on the side of your existence. Yeah, so it appears to be contingent, so it appears to be contingent

739
01:10:18.570 --> 01:10:27.890
iPhone: these historical unfoldings, but regarded on the side of their philosophically organized, comprehended organization, it is the science of knowing in this year of the

740
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:30.129
iPhone: plus the history of philosophy is

741
01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:34.199
iPhone:  knowledge itself.

742
01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:47.569
iPhone: as it appears in history. The 2 together comprehended history. like the innerizing and the Calvary of the Absolute Spirit

743
01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.420
iPhone: just on the cross.

744
01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:59.719
iPhone: the actuality, truth, certainly, of His throne now, which he would be like this alone, only from the.

745
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:06.699
iPhone: So anyway, that was, that was kind of a

746
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:11.219
iPhone: that's where we're at. It's still going. Okay? Last thing. Okay? So

747
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:17.590
iPhone: substance versus subjects. Okay? So it's it's you know.

748
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.210
iPhone: I think what we saw.

749
01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.380
iPhone: you know.

750
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.240
iPhone: you have.

751
01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:32.040
iPhone: I think this is kind of like, actually sort of what he was getting out of that night. Business.

752
01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:36.269
iPhone: The the substance

753
01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:38.359
iPhone: about darkness.

754
01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:41.250
iPhone: It's the one substance.

755
01:11:41.690 --> 01:11:46.889
iPhone: and then it just like unfolds over time. You have to get in the snow

756
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:48.849
iPhone: attributes in its modes.

757
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:54.799
iPhone: but it doesn't anticipate any.

758
01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:04.959
iPhone:  So that's that's mere substance substance. As because for Hegel, that is some sense, in some sense there. Isn't it all necessary?

759
01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:09.200
iPhone: But it's also simultaneously

760
01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:11.530
iPhone: here. It is doing this to itself.

761
01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:12.789
iPhone: but it

762
01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:17.830
iPhone: and realizing itself.

763
01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:23.659
iPhone: we're asked for when I was a mirror almost mechanistic

764
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:25.319
iPhone: all the way.

765
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:29.990
iPhone:  which?

766
01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.530
iPhone: Okay, so

767
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:38.080
iPhone: is.

768
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:40.970
iPhone: yeah.

769
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:45.819
iPhone: nearly that. I mean, it's just saying that

770
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.699
iPhone: it's as it as I. Yeah, I mean.

771
01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.030
iPhone: it's

772
01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:57.369
iPhone: as he said repeatedly, in the practice for those of these, it's reason.

773
01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:59.250
iPhone: substance.

774
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.730
iPhone: It's actually

775
01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:04.550
iPhone: we're in this business. And then, yeah, it's

776
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:14.179
iPhone:  okay? And then.

777
01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:22.509
iPhone: yeah. And what we're as for in this fantastic substance is, this is a part of what's going on in the darkness and

778
01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.000
iPhone: mental.

779
01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.560
iPhone: the sub, the substance that mental, the only one after

780
01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:31.800
iPhone: there's a bodily substitute, the bodily attribute.

781
01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:37.969
iPhone: I want to know this so mental and body.

782
01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:41.750
iPhone: and the problem with.

783
01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:54.770
iPhone: So now, I'm just trying to respond to, because yet one of the interaction with my. But the problem is that okay? And that that means that it must be some

784
01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.279
iPhone: blind, dark

785
01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.740
iPhone: thing that's unfolding throughout history.

786
01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:01.560
iPhone: That has nothing to do with that

787
01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:05.530
iPhone: for us. I will say no, but mental.

788
01:14:07.330 --> 01:14:08.940
iPhone: It's it's here.

789
01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.509
iPhone: there's no, these are not separate.

790
01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:14.600
Hmm.

791
01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.079
iPhone: so that's that's that's part of it.

792
01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:20.330
Okay.

793
01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:30.119
iPhone: it's really abstract. So

794
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:33.770
iPhone: is that because, of course, this is history, too.

795
01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.150
iPhone: the whole world. And it's

796
01:14:37.530 --> 01:14:41.490
iPhone: the imminent principle of the universe come to know itself as as just that.

797
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:52.900
iPhone: Would it be to say that

798
01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.319
iPhone: the Christian God embodies the

799
01:14:57.550 --> 01:15:00.280
iPhone: yes, yeah.

800
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:05.670
iPhone: this is pantheism. So this is a return of this in the mode of philosophy.

801
01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.970
iPhone: So in the mode of images, you have antheism.

802
01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:10.069
iPhone: which is the dark.

803
01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:17.100
iPhone: That is an emergent immersion. What here is there? But it's it's not unifying the matters of.

804
01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:21.360
iPhone: Yeah, they have been reconciled.

805
01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:25.369
iPhone: and then in the and then in religion you get

806
01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:29.689
iPhone: light. The whole thing is here all the way down.

807
01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:33.329
iPhone: This is philosophy. Now the the

808
01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:38.470
iPhone: this is or no, actually just Pantheon.

809
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:44.589
iPhone: And it's it's it's it's actually it's it's it's it's it's in the universe. But also a little more.

810
01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:47.680
iPhone: but I think it's not really just.

811
01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:51.370
iPhone: And then you get Hegel.

812
01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.329
iPhone: So you have

813
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:58.620
iPhone: some of the

814
01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:08.829
iPhone: yeah. So Christianity is a revelation, but only in images, not in philosophical concepts, that it's all the way down.

815
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:16.470
iPhone: It's in the story of the creation. And then Jesus is live death and resurrection.

816
01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:22.550
iPhone: because get, as he says, is the ultimate separation.

817
01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:27.049
iPhone: But

818
01:16:29.690 --> 01:16:31.479
iPhone: his den is an ultimate darkness, too.

819
01:16:39.570 --> 01:16:40.650
iPhone: dancing back.

820
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:46.070
iPhone: and it's but it's just one

821
01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:47.470
iPhone: subways himself.

822
01:16:49.090 --> 01:16:59.709
iPhone: Oh, so on on separation. If I go to the yeah. Oh, some

823
01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:10.399
iPhone:  I suppose mediation is just an on  I guess it's it.

824
01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.930
iPhone: It made them easy.

825
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:13.820
iPhone: So like

826
01:17:14.850 --> 01:17:16.310
iPhone: we're at the.

827
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:22.590
iPhone: you know, like you, you can sort of forget the process of

828
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:27.920
iPhone:  I was just

829
01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:44.600
iPhone: I, or even Plato, the from there, and you get this immediate intuition and on the spiritual level of not physical sensuousness, the spiritual

830
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:48.289
iPhone:  rather than

831
01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:52.449
iPhone: can't understand. It doesn't all right here.

832
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:53.490
Oh, no.

833
01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:56.639
iPhone: forms are not just, and I know I haven't

834
01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:04.440
iPhone:  whereas of

835
01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.930
iPhone: is more focused on the

836
01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:17.340
iPhone:  The process by which you can attend this this new level after you.

837
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:25.999
iPhone: Unstable unity, mitigation of that.

838
01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.529
iPhone: but positing a difference.

839
01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:33.099
iPhone: And then

840
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:39.209
iPhone: so like you're here, you get a positive difference. So like you might have to go back to like

841
01:18:41.230 --> 01:18:43.759
iPhone: we get a pausing of a difference.

842
01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:49.470
iPhone: Yeah.

843
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:53.179
iPhone: but it's still. it's still separate.

844
01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.720
iPhone: you know.

845
01:18:56.950 --> 01:19:00.250
iPhone: But separation is that that emphasis

846
01:19:00.370 --> 01:19:02.300
iPhone: on the moment of

847
01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:08.530
iPhone: as as opposed to mediation, which is just a

848
01:19:09.790 --> 01:19:10.860
iPhone: Well, yeah.

849
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:14.390
iPhone: like mediation is the over time

850
01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.620
iPhone: of the

851
01:19:23.490 --> 01:19:30.869
iPhone: I'd say that the afterwards of simulation is like the the next level of object aviation is the historical.

852
01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:34.370
iPhone: Yeah, something like that.

853
01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:35.490
Okay, yeah.

854
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.809
iPhone: really, it's almost

855
01:19:38.010 --> 01:19:38.980
okay. Yeah.

856
01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.050
iPhone: One is just been emphasizing

857
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:44.929
iPhone: how the how we can.

858
01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.290
iPhone: whereas

859
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:53.659
iPhone: all. And that gives us a new that makes sense.

860
01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:12.770
iPhone: Still pretty abstract. I know. Well, that's things. Why do we? We can let me just skip to the intro to do you like one of me tomorrow? Yeah, let's get to the intro.

861
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:22.559
iPhone: I'll I'll see you. There might be one or 2 things in the breakfast, so we'll just like one or 2. Okay, and then we can get to the intro. But the intro is about, I mean, I can tell you it.

862
01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:28.840
iPhone: So I'll let you guys go ahead. But

863
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:40.620
iPhone: he what he what he starts right away with in the intro is how you can get philosophy, and it will be talking specifically about taunting a lot.

864
01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.400
iPhone: Okay, we'll see. I'll try to point that out

865
01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:47.759
iPhone: that. Take this for. And then they asked, How

866
01:20:48.230 --> 01:20:50.579
iPhone: can I be sure that this is?

867
01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:51.990
iPhone: I can notice?

868
01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:58.819
iPhone: And so they start with a problem with the bridge. And so how do I know that they, this

869
01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.309
being stored?

870
01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:02.830
iPhone: Because that's

871
01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.230
iPhone:  the mind isn't kind of filter.

872
01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:14.099
iPhone: and that we don't get this kind of store to images of the thing. But the thing is like, how did you ever come to think that there wasn't

873
01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:21.760
iPhone: because you forgot that you?

874
01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:35.780
iPhone: Okay, so and he starts with that. And he says, this is a problem. We need to overcome it in the magazine. This is how that happened. In the first place.

875
01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:39.140
iPhone: how we got even to lock.

876
01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:53.960
iPhone: because that's the thing. Okay. All I know is that here's another kind of trying to remember all these things. That they're actually been helpful to me

877
01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:55.640
iPhone: is

878
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:10.600
iPhone: that's what he saying. If you can't understand

879
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:17.149
iPhone: anyone that you can explain the various species of

880
01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:23.699
iPhone: actually don't know what they're doing. You think it's just making an argument?

881
01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:26.199
iPhone: No, he's expressing a form of consciousness

882
01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.259
iPhone: in which this argument makes sense

883
01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:35.779
iPhone: a small like the code.

884
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.400
iPhone: Yes, of course.

885
01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:41.650
iPhone: And of course the coasting is. There's never an absolute desire or final reconciliation.

886
01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:48.890
iPhone: That's as I was saying, all these French guys are responding to. There's no phone, all difference.

887
01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:55.809
iPhone: And any attempt to reconcile. Is it all near?

888
01:22:58.150 --> 01:23:00.270
iPhone: it's actually one part.

889
01:23:03.170 --> 01:23:06.239
iPhone: the slot, the master slave

890
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:10.290
iPhone: in a

891
01:23:11.650 --> 01:23:18.489
iPhone: yeah and and but yes, but in that history, yeah, they they yeah. We all understood this partly. Sure

892
01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.190
iPhone: airlines.

893
01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:28.660
iPhone: The object is radically different. You can't. We inhabit the world in the past? In some sense

894
01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:31.790
iPhone: I will hit those point that it's actually present one

895
01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:42.450
iPhone: which is kind of a concept right?

896
01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:47.389
iPhone: When you say you want to be the role in able to. Yes, of course, in the world

897
01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:51.120
iPhone: we can overcome the alienation that I

898
01:23:56.710 --> 01:24:01.300
iPhone: that makes sense, like as a kind of rough, rough and ready. Yeah, for sure. Don't stop that.

899
01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:04.509
iPhone: It's just I mean, the thing is that that's kind of the

900
01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:15.170
iPhone: the kind of cliche way to put it that for for because it like Gary Dodds and things, he said this people without the absolute

901
01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:19.079
iPhone: Everything is changing.

902
01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:24.700
iPhone: There's no reconciliation that the goal of.

903
01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:29.889
iPhone: but it's not entirely inaccurate. So the cliche has some sense

904
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:35.559
iPhone: which is to to give them break for their really, since maybe they're correct.

905
01:24:37.190 --> 01:24:38.510
iPhone: But they're not

906
01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.650
yeah cool.

907
01:24:45.280 --> 01:25:06.050
iPhone: Laura. I'm sorry. No, worries. Don't worry about me. Do you have any last questions. No, I did have a question, what did it come in person tomorrow? But where are you guys? Are you in the? We're just outside the the Boston department. Okay, that's what I thought. Okay, on the first floor. Slavery.

908
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:10.959
Laura Jo Swartley: Okay. I might be a little late, but I'd like to come in person, who is a little hard to hear, but this is great. Thank you so much.

909
01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:17.260
iPhone: Yeah, for sure, our pleasure.
