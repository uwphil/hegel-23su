Miscellaneous general notes.

### Disagreement in Philosophy
One important point (to follow up on today's session) or way to frame things is to ask yourself: "Why do I find this philosophy convincing while others do not?" "Why am I convinced by this or that philosophical claim or position while others aren't? Are they just being obtuse? Do they just not get it? Why do this happen?" Hegel would have us actually explain this fact. To cut to the chase, what determines whether or not one is receptive to a certain philosophy, according to Hegel, depends on one's level of development. A useful way to frame this is to recall an old Scholastic metaphysical law: "effects are received according to the mode of the patient." Thus, the same soundwaves will be received differently depending upon if the patient is a rock, a dog, a human, a human that speaks the language, etc. So, similarly, the same philosophical positions, arguments, etc. will be received by different people according to their "mode," i.e. the SAME philosophy will produce a different effect. Of course, there is no way to step outside of one's current viewpoint to compare the "effect" the philosophy has had on one with the philosophy "in itself" but that's a problem of objectivity that we'll tackle later. This, of course, can also sound chauvinistic, i.e. "you disagree with me because you're not on my level." But the alternative would seem to be that no one ever needs to change, perhaps radically change, themselves and their viewpoint in order become adequate to the philosophy they would understand, i.e. that is currently producing an effect in them. That is perhaps the deeper chauvinist of the individual egoism that insists there is nothing higher than their current viewpoint, so all things must conform to it. It is to render the very notion of development (a core part of Hegelianism) meaningless.

### Starting the *Phenomenology*
I'll try to gather some notes for this but just a couple of quick points. 1. Remember, Hegel is not simply critiquing contrary philosophical positions but is explaining how they come to exist in the first place. Thus, he is doing a phenomenology of the succession of forms of consciousness which give rise to the various philosophies. He won't always tell you, though, that he is explaining the emergence of specific philosophies. I'll try to help you notice this. 2. The first form of consciousness we examine, "Sense-certainty," locates the absolute in the immediate sensuous object or what Hegel describes as "This, Here, Now." The expectation that the absolute is to be found in the immediate sensuous object gives rise to a variety of naive realisms and empiricisms. Importantly, consciousness is soon frustrated in its attempt to grasp the absolute in the immediate sensuous object since the immediate sensuous object is always changing and so hardly absolute. So, the naive confidence of Sense-certainty quickly reverses to it opposite, i.e. an equally naive skepticism which maintains that, since the immediate sensuous object turns out not to be absolute and thus it is impossible to grasp such an absolute, nothing is certain. But, this is just the beginning...
