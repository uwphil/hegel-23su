# Meeting Transcript, Meeting 4

## AI Summary

The conversation begins with a reference to Hegel's philosophy and the concept of spirit. It is suggested that Hegel posits a fundamental demand within individuals, a desire for something external to satisfy their inner expectations. This demand manifests itself through our questioning and pursuit of knowledge.

The distinction between "in itself" and "for itself" in Hegelian philosophy is explored. "In itself" refers to a state where something exists but lacks self-direction or self-objectification. In contrast, "for itself" implies a self-directed entity that possesses the ability to initiate its own direction and is aware of its own existence.

The relationship between humanity and nature is discussed. Nature is characterized as being "in itself," existing independently of human consciousness. Humanity, however, is seen as "for itself," representing self-consciousness and self-objectification. Hegel's philosophy suggests that human history represents a progression from nature's self-objectification to humanity's self-objectification.

The conversation acknowledges the ambiguity surrounding Hegel's use of the terms "in itself" and "for itself." One interpretation proposed is that "for itself" can be understood as something being directed towards itself or having a relationship with a person's consciousness.

The concept of final causes in nature is examined. Hegel's philosophy seeks to transcend the reductionist approach of Newtonian science and recognizes a dynamic aspect within nature, moving away from a strictly mechanistic understanding. The idea of final causes suggests that nature has inherent purposes or goals that drive its development.

The conversation touches upon the notion of the "thing in itself," which refers to how something appears to us versus its true essence. Hegel's philosophy aims to reintegrate science and philosophy, rejecting the notion that science must eliminate teleological explanations or final causes from nature.

Additionally, the discussion delves into the role of personal experience in understanding philosophical concepts. It is recognized that concepts such as "in itself" and "for itself" require careful examination and lived experience to grasp their full meaning and significance.

Overall, the conversation revolves around Hegel's ideas of spirit, the distinction between "in itself" and "for itself," the relationship between humanity and nature, the significance of final causes in nature, the integration of science and philosophy, and the importance of personal experience in understanding philosophical concepts. These ideas intertwine and offer different perspectives on how we relate to the world and the nature of our consciousness.


What does Hegel mean by "spirit" and the fundamental demand within individuals?
Answer: Hegel posits that individuals have a fundamental demand, a desire for something external to satisfy their inner expectations. This demand manifests itself through our questioning and pursuit of knowledge.

What is the distinction between "in itself" and "for itself" in Hegelian philosophy?

How does Hegel view the relationship between humanity and nature?
Answer: Nature is seen as "in itself," existing independently of human consciousness. Humanity, on the other hand, is viewed as "for itself," representing self-consciousness and self-objectification. Human history is considered a progression from nature's self-objectification to humanity's self-objectification.

What does "for itself" mean in Hegelian philosophy?
Answer: "For itself" can be understood as something being directed towards itself or having a relationship with a person's consciousness.

How does Hegel's philosophy challenge the reductionist approach of Newtonian science?
Answer: Hegel's philosophy recognizes a dynamic aspect within nature, moving away from a strictly mechanistic understanding. It embraces the idea of final causes, suggesting that nature has inherent purposes or goals that drive its development.

What is the concept of the "thing in itself"?
Answer: The "thing in itself" refers to how something appears to us versus its true essence. Hegel's philosophy aims to reintegrate science and philosophy, rejecting the notion that science must eliminate teleological explanations or final causes from nature.

How can philosophical concepts like "in itself" and "for itself" be understood through personal experience?
Answer: It is acknowledged that grasping the full meaning and significance of concepts like "in itself" and "for itself" requires careful examination and lived experience. Personal experiences can provide insight into the nature of our consciousness and help us understand these philosophical concepts.

Question: "What is Hegel's view on the concept of progress?"
Answer: Hegel sees history as a progression of consciousness, where human understanding and self-awareness develop over time, leading to the realization of freedom and the actualization of spirit.

Question: "How does Hegel address the concept of self-objectification?"
Answer: Hegel argues that self-objectification is a process through which self-consciousness encounters and externalizes itself in the world, forming a reciprocal relationship between subject and object.

Question: "What is Hegel's understanding of phenomenology?"
Answer: Hegel's phenomenology explores the subjective experiences of consciousness and the development of self-consciousness, aiming to understand how knowledge and truth are attained through the dialectical movement of thought.

Mark Pock: hey? Do you guys have the zoom link?

2
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.940
Mark Pock: It's on the website. It's on on the discord.

3
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.289
Mark Pock: I can send it in this. Oh, the what I was for it! There's a website

4
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:38.539
Mark Pock: I don't know. I'll wait. Okay, no, I don't have it. I'll I'll send in this for you.

5
00:00:45.480 --> 00:01:00.289
Mark Pock:  you you sent it on discord.

6
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.800
Mark Pock: All right.

7
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.710
Mark Pock: Well, actually. what I thought

8
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.869
Mark Pock: we can do is actually just start reading through the introduction.

9
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.380
Mark Pock: And

10
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.249
Mark Pock: there's we are already quite a bit

11
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.599
Mark Pock: in the first couple of paragraphs. Alright. So let's just do that.

12
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.960
Mark Pock: So

13
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:47.829
Mark Pock: it's a natural assumption that in philosophy, before we start deal with, it's proper subject matter, namely, the actual cognition of what truly is. One was first of all come to you with an understanding and understanding about cognition.

14
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.479
Mark Pock: which is regarded either as an instrument to get hold of the absolute or a medium through which one discovers it.

15
00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.080
Mark Pock:  so what do you. Yeah, hopefully. By the way, for those of you that

16
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:17.079
Mark Pock: I didn't inform. There's a there in the back of the book. There is a full commentary on this. Yeah, on each paragraph. So it's it's hit or miss. But some of them are very helpful. Yeah, by Finley, yeah.

17
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.219
Mark Pock:  And so if you go back you'll see that he's he makes this clear.

18
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:33.940
Mark Pock: And it. It's true that this is the same Hegel's more or less referring to. and I block here, but just definitely

19
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.990
Mark Pock:  but

20
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.010
Mark Pock: more generally speaking, he's referring to this.

21
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.610
Mark Pock: I suppose

22
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.570
Mark Pock: effort that was launched, if you will, in the kind of early modern to modern period.

23
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.570
Mark Pock: where? Okay? So obviously, so like, just like the briefest of little things. Here

24
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.979
Mark Pock: you have

25
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.950
Mark Pock: you know. sort of pre-modern

26
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.170
Mark Pock:  metaphysics.

27
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.230
Mark Pock: And this this is

28
00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:25.220
Mark Pock: cliche is, but it's on the on it, and not entirely.

29
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.730
Mark Pock: You're running us. So Pre. And we metaphysics is first philosophy.

30
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.200
Mark Pock: which is to say, the study of the absolute of being. It is first. Yes.

31
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.430
Mark Pock: because, of course, that's the most important thing to be the you want to start with with most of our thing. so

32
00:04:47.500 --> 00:05:03.519
Mark Pock:  for it's Aristotle played away or onwards. Metaphysics is first philosophy, then things, and and thus every other science sort of devolves from this. So, for example, famously.

33
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.420
Mark Pock: Aristotle's account of cognition of knowing is

34
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.949
Mark Pock: organizing metaphysical terms of potency and acts. Those are metaphysical terms.

35
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.380
Mark Pock: And remember, we talked about the phenomenology class.

36
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.140
Mark Pock:  Aristotle. And up to

37
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.769
Mark Pock: well, yeah, up through at least the late Middle Ages.

38
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.280
Mark Pock: they had begun to develop a technique by which to study these acts.

39
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.299
Mark Pock: Conscious acts for themselves, co cognitional acts for themselves.

40
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:46.169
Mark Pock: that is a method for for doing that. So, in other words, they would. They would apply the same method to motion, to

41
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.969
Mark Pock: biological processes, to merely animal processes

42
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.730
Mark Pock: that they would to cognition, because it was all kind of devolved from a basic metaphysics of potency and act

43
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.089
Mark Pock: and cause potencies. 1, one of the things we'll get to your potencies.

44
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.690
Mark Pock: There are different policies.

45
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.360
Mark Pock: and sometimes this gets

46
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.329
Mark Pock: you'll see it to talk about us back on some

47
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.859
Mark Pock: So you have a faculty of

48
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.920
Mark Pock: vegetation. But you also have a faculty of sensation.

49
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.730
Mark Pock: faculty of understanding, and the faculty of reason.

50
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.220
Mark Pock: And those are all

51
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.650
Mark Pock:  things that are potentialities in you that get actuated.

52
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:44.830
Mark Pock:  and those actually much more to be said about this. It's called faculty psychology. So that if that's what he is, psychology is the metaphysics of

53
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.270
Mark Pock: cognition

54
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.410
Mark Pock:  But the point being is that for right now meditating was first lost

55
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.340
Mark Pock: and everything. And then the ethics, ethics is just again

56
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.320
Mark Pock: the goal of Aristotelian ethics.

57
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.800
Mark Pock: The tell us

58
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:10.289
Mark Pock: of this, teleologies, eudaemonia happiness, which is better translated as flourishing, which is to say, fulfillment, which is to say.

59
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.750
Mark Pock: fulfilling your nature as a rap with all of these faculties, bring them to full act. Intellectuality.

60
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.599
Mark Pock: So because, remember, the ultimate pot and C is

61
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:29.759
Mark Pock: news. Human news is potentially making me becoming all things. God is all things. And there's a journey of what's going to full actualization.

62
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.590
Mark Pock: Okay? And

63
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.020
Mark Pock: as opposed to in starting in. I guess you would call modernity.

64
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.260
Mark Pock: and he kind of

65
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.929
Mark Pock: where you could call it epistemology. If you want

66
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.229
Mark Pock: it comes first. Philosophy. That's what Descartes.

67
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.049
Mark Pock: what is called the meditation on first Philosophy.

68
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.790
Mark Pock: And he's saying, actually what we need before we can study

69
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.770
Mark Pock: being. yeah, absolutely.

70
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.189
Mark Pock: we need to know

71
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.989
Mark Pock:  is the mind capable of knowing the absolute

72
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.410
Mark Pock: first.

73
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.740
Mark Pock: So we have to study cognition first

74
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:38.770
Mark Pock: see it. Our cognition is adequate to knowing the absolute Descartes.  is it? It doesn't do quite yet what

75
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.820
Mark Pock: comes out more clearly in

76
00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:49.640
Mark Pock: lock. And then cons, they're a little bit more explicit about because Descartes, actual epistemology, winds up. Being pretty

77
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.200
Mark Pock: scholastic.

78
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.060
Mark Pock: he talks about essentially faculties.

79
00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.839
Mark Pock: but he, he says

80
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:05.079
Mark Pock: he doesn't necessarily start with them, but he, because this is the whole thing. I think. There for him. The I is. This kind of

81
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:16.819
Mark Pock: it's it's something new. It's a so it's a new method, first of all, so that they they got a discourse on method and then meditation on first philosophy. And he's developing

82
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.860
Mark Pock: kind of getting off the ground a method by which you you approach.

83
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.059
Mark Pock: So another way of thinking about this this is, this is

84
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:36.280
Mark Pock:  we can. This is not erroneous, but it gets called. It's there's a longer story here. So this is

85
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.870
Mark Pock: subject.

86
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.480
Mark Pock: And so far we're talking about Ca cognition. We're talking on the subject as object.

87
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:52.209
Mark Pock: and Descartes starts to transition out from you. Study subject to subject.

88
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.459
Mark Pock: That's very far. He's like I said he gets.

89
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:04.610
Mark Pock: He's still trapped in a lot of scholastic metaphysics.

90
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.910
Mark Pock: But

91
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.220
Mark Pock: something happens with the

92
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:16.050
Mark Pock: yeah. Do that. I think, therefore, I am that kind of self certainty of the subject as as its own

93
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.640
Mark Pock: in its own subjectivity rather than that. It's just a bearer of faculties

94
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:28.880
Mark Pock:  But like I said, he doesn't do, he kind of gets that kind of going. But

95
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.979
Mark Pock: here, when he says, Okay.

96
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.770
Mark Pock: what we need to do is,

97
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:47.939
Mark Pock: We must first of all come to an understanding about cognition, which is regarded either as an instrument to get hold of the absolute, or as a medium through which one discovers it. That's more becomes more explicit in lock, and then even more so in con, which is to say.

98
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.160
Mark Pock: we need to establish

99
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.130
Mark Pock: the nature and limits of the mind

100
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.589
Mark Pock: before we start talking about whether or not it can know the absolute.

101
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.289
Mark Pock: because the presumption is, maybe it's distorting it.

102
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.090
Mark Pock: and also.

103
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.950
Mark Pock: maybe it can't know the absolute at all

104
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.679
Mark Pock: as absolute. And we need to recognize that because it's the illusion that these

105
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:22.929
Mark Pock:  you know scholastics, and so on, that thought that they could discourse

106
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.240
Mark Pock: coherently about the nature of God, for instance.

107
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:35.319
Mark Pock: that gave rise to all those intellectual disputes that gave us the religious wars. Right? So what they're saying is, look, we presume, to know about the absolute

108
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:43.030
Mark Pock: and what Constant says. No, we have to limit knowledge, to make room for faith in order to understand that we don't know the absolute.

109
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.739
Mark Pock: and therefore we need to stop arguing about it.

110
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:57.740
Mark Pock: And so we need to. And that's all tied into this idea that okay, we need to establish the nature of the limits, the nature, and the limits of this

111
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.310
Mark Pock: this process of cognition by itself.

112
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:06.499
Mark Pock: prior to, and so to some degree, that means being absolutely

113
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.340
Mark Pock: as distinct from the study of being, of being

114
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:22.550
Mark Pock:  again.  in order to establish the nature and the limits of this. So we don't transgress them.

115
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:32.359
Mark Pock: This is, you know, if you want to go full post modern. This is a policing mechanism. Okay. but it's also its own thing.

116
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:40.210
Mark Pock: Try to take it on its own terms. To which is there they think they're trying to solve a problem.  

117
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:55.859
Mark Pock: okay, so I guess to keep going and stop me, any time, good questions so certain on the easiness seems justified. partly because there are different types of cognition, and one of them might be appropriate to more perfectly than another for the attainment of this goal, knowing the absolute.

118
00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:02.330
Mark Pock: so that we could make a bad choice of a means. and partly because cognition is a faculty

119
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:11.170
Mark Pock: of a definite kind and scope, and thus, without a more precise definition of its nature and limits, we might grasp clouds of error instead of the heaven of truth.

120
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:22.380
Mark Pock: which is what Kant and Lock and all the modern, said the scholastics we're doing. They're just talking about angels on the head of a PIN. You guys know about all that stuff.

121
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.829
Mark Pock: So they would have debates about how many the angels can you fit on the head of a pen? Because

122
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:42.639
Mark Pock: God is. God alone is pure spirit. and so is doesn't exist in place or time. But angels are don't have bodies. but they can't. They're not peer spirits, so do they take up any space at all.

123
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:57.939
Mark Pock: and so, presumably they don't. But they can't be pure spirit. So it's like, well, they maybe they have this like really fine spiritual body. And then you ask how many of them can fit on the head of a PIN? Another famous one? This is

124
00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.950
Mark Pock: another famous one

125
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:08.819
Mark Pock: that they debated. And the thing is, some of this is a caricature like they weren't. It's actually not quite. This is the modern reaction to this. But it's kind of a caricature.

126
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.330
Mark Pock: Some of these debates really weren't really happening.

127
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:19.549
Mark Pock: but it some kind of a Jake. Things that were adjacent to this were happening. Like one thing I think they were debating at 1 point was

128
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.850
Mark Pock:  whether or not the will stink in the afterlife.

129
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.840
Mark Pock: because

130
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:36.040
Mark Pock: for the Christian tradition. Specifically, we're classics. Obviously, we're using philosophy to kind of develop Christian thought.

131
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.239
Mark Pock: It's not simply a spiritual

132
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.170
Mark Pock: after life, right as it might be for

133
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:53.239
Mark Pock: Plato, perhaps, or any number of other views. Pythagoreanism, like you kind of want to get out of the the body is the the of the soul. For for Plato.

134
00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:01.709
Mark Pock: for Christianity. One key difference, at least they would, they would claim, is the notion of a bodily or resurrection.

135
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.729
Mark Pock: Your Chris is resurrected in body.

136
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.470
Mark Pock: The that stone is removed from the

137
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:17.760
Mark Pock: Tom, and he's gone. His body is not daring, so he's been resurrected. Okay, but and that's a big deal for Christianity. But

138
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.550
Mark Pock: And the part of the point is that

139
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:36.089
Mark Pock: unless we are in body where resurrected, it's not really a true resurrection, because we are embodied in our bodies, and we need them to be who we are, we, we would otherwise lose our identity. Okay, so, but if it is a true resurrection, and it's a true bodily resurrection

140
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.040
Mark Pock: body shit

141
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:46.170
Mark Pock: in heaven. There's supposed to be no pain, no discomfort, including smelling bad things. So if it's going to be a full bodily resurrection

142
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.199
Mark Pock: with defecation. Is that defecation going to okay and then to debate this?

144
00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.710
Mark Pock: now, anyway?

145
00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:07.520
Mark Pock: so they were. And that's like, you know, they're talking. They're grasping at clouds of error instead of the actual heaven, the real heaven of truth. Okay.

146
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:12.700
Mark Pock: this classics. We're doing that because they weren't doing according to cons.

147
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:20.600
Mark Pock: and who Hegel is referring to because they didn't establish the limits because it turns out no one's ever met an angel.

148
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.299
Mark Pock: No one's ever been resurrected. And

149
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:34.959
Mark Pock: you know at least a human that that that's beyond our experience. We can have a faith that okay, yeah, in heaven. We'll have full bodies that defecate, but they won't smell. But there's no way we could know that.

150
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.670
Mark Pock: because it's beyond the scope of our cognition.

151
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.339
Mark Pock: and so we need to shut up about it.

152
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:52.099
Mark Pock: and don't fight over it. Okay, this feeling of the uneasiness that is uneasiness. about.

153
00:16:53.720 --> 00:17:05.329
Mark Pock: can we actually know the Absolute is surely bound to be transformed into the conviction that the whole project of securing consciousness, 4. Consciousness through cognition. What exists in itself is absurd.

154
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.900
Mark Pock: That's the modern thing here.

155
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:14.570
Mark Pock: and that there's a boundary between cognition and the absolute that completely separates them. Of course it's the problem of the bridge.

156
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:27.629
Mark Pock: for of cognition is the instrument for getting hold of absolute being is obvious. That the use of an instrument on a thing certainly does not let it be what it is for itself, but rather sets out to reshape and alter it.

157
00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:40.979
Mark Pock: If, on the other hand, cognition is not an instrument of our activity, but a more or less passive medium through which the light of the truth reaches us. Then, again, we do not receive the truth as it is in itself, but only as it exists through

158
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:51.910
Mark Pock: and in this medium. Either way, we employ a means which immediately brings about the opposite of its own end, or rather, what is really absurd is that we should make use of a means at all.

159
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.040
Mark Pock: I'll keep going

160
00:17:54.050 --> 00:18:01.029
Mark Pock: cause there's more that he said about that point. But I'll just keep going because it might be more sense in the second year.

161
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.360
Mark Pock: It would seem

162
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:07.649
Mark Pock: to be to be sure that this evil could be in. Okay, so could be remedied

163
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:16.359
Mark Pock: through an acquaintance with the way in which the instrument works. This is the cons transcendental method he's going to

164
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:21.700
Mark Pock:  show how the mind acts upon the object

165
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.509
Mark Pock:  walk to.

166
00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:41.920
Mark Pock: or this would enable us to eliminate from the representation of the absolute which we have gained through it whatever is due to the instrument, and thus get the truth in its purity. But this improvement would, in fact, only bring us back to where we were before.

167
00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.000
Mark Pock: If we remove

168
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:53.179
Mark Pock: from a reshaped thing with the instrument has done to it, then the thing here the absolutely comes for us exactly what it was before this, accordingly, superfluous effort.

169
00:18:53.490 --> 00:19:04.389
Mark Pock: on the other hand, if the Absolute is supposed to be nearly brought near to us through this instrument without anything in it being altered like a bird caught in the lime twig, it would surely laugh our little reduced to scorn it

170
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:21.599
Mark Pock: if it were not with us, and then for itself all along. And that was on relation for a reason, just what cognition would be in such a case, since it would, with manifold exertions, be giving itself the air of doing something quite different from creating a merely immediate and therefore effortless relationship.

171
00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.769
Mark Pock: or by testing, if by testing and cognition me, which we can see

172
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.650
Mark Pock: of as a medium. We get to know

173
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:50.969
Mark Pock: the law of its refraction. It is again useless to subtract this from the end result. for it is not the refraction of the ray, but the ray itself, or my truth reaches us, that is cognition, and if this were removed, all that would be indicated would be a pure direction or a plank space. Okay, what he's saying, of course, is this. So if if you have

174
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.830
Mark Pock: you have

175
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.129
Mark Pock: the absolute over here.

176
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.669
Mark Pock: hey? And we're worried. That.

177
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:10.829
Mark Pock: And this is not a joke, as I mentioned before, you can see or to perceive literally means to grab. hey, grab with so as we grab it.

178
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.480
Mark Pock: and we pull it to ourselves so that we can know it.

179
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.189
Mark Pock: But now it looks like this, then it's been shaped. By the way we grab it.

180
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:23.380
Mark Pock: hey? And so now, it's not the absolute.

181
00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.740
Mark Pock: Okay? So what if I

182
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.449
Mark Pock: eliminate the effect I have on

183
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:39.460
Mark Pock: by Rect, by doing this critique of the cognition itself. Well, then, now it's back over here.

184
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:47.750
Mark Pock: and I the then how how well, I know that is the actual thing anymore, because I've just removed my cognition of it.

185
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.450
Mark Pock: It's the comparison problem once again.

186
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.100
Mark Pock: because this is the only way in which I've ever known it.

187
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.880
Okay, I've removed my effect lines.

188
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.010
Mark Pock:  but if that's the only way I've ever known it, I can't know it as it is over here.

189
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:13.480
Mark Pock: and there's no third point, because there's no third position. I can compare these 2. Say, Oh, yeah, this is the thing

190
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:18.810
Mark Pock: separated from the the influence of my cognition, because my cognition is happening up here, too.

191
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:38.519
Mark Pock: Yeah, that's what he's saying. or or or if it's a kind of medium that, like works its way through like cognition, is this medium? And then you have the representation over here. Well, then, remove the medium

192
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.519
Mark Pock: and don't get this.

193
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.119
Mark Pock: and you're just left with this that you haven't known yet.

194
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.090
Mark Pock: like the uncertainty

195
00:21:55.670 --> 00:22:08.420
Mark Pock: it's velocity at the same time location in. But of course, like the knowing one affects the other. Is that right?

196
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:14.149
Mark Pock: Yeah, it's related. It's actually in some way. But it's actually it's different, because those are all

197
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.449
Mark Pock: that's all talking still about.

198
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:31.610
Mark Pock: They always aren't necessarily epistemologies. As such. They're kind of running into a epistemological problem.  but they aren't necessarily talking about, not because then the question is, okay, what is

199
00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.449
Mark Pock: what is this thing that's perceiving?

200
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.469
Mark Pock: And that would be epistemology.

201
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.700
Mark Pock:  or philosophy of science.

202
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:50.170
Mark Pock: But this is specific to okay, if you.

203
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:56.140
Mark Pock: it's just a problem, because it's. And then so what Kant says, okay.

204
00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.260
Mark Pock: and the absolute is just unknowable.

205
00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.679
Mark Pock: So no, say, well, because our cognition is intrinsically distortive.

206
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.330
Mark Pock: We could only know phenomena. And the

207
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:17.840
Mark Pock: I think you had this right in your note. Yeah, yeah, that's that. I think what you said was pretty much right. Exactly what he was saying. Is that is that what you're getting at?

208
00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:21.109
Mark Pock: yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.439
Mark Pock: Yeah. So it seems, I'm referring back to the problem of the bridge.

210
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:39.820
Mark Pock: Right? I guess I was asking about. I said it was paragraph 75,

211
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.000
Mark Pock: because I guess with a circle.

212
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:46.720
Mark Pock: there, I guess it's talking about trees there. So I'm wondering about

213
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.370
Mark Pock: to what extent?

214
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.010
Mark Pock: there is a truth.

215
00:23:51.180 --> 00:24:01.000
Mark Pock: or there's a because we can get to the idos. Remember, zoom, is that the like corollary of the absolute for us, or through

216
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.860
Mark Pock: purely phenomenal investigation?

217
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:10.229
Mark Pock: Right? Yeah. But that's always a problem, right? Because it's like it's trapped in imminent still. Yeah.

218
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.919
Mark Pock: And it's a but

219
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:20.740
Mark Pock:  yeah, yeah.

221
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:34.340
Mark Pock: who? Sarah was trying to get us on faculty psychology. And the Ipo, yeah, the knowledge as an instrument.

222
00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.220
Mark Pock: That's certainly true.

223
00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:42.440
Mark Pock: And and so

224
00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:50.189
Mark Pock:  But the question will remain like, Okay, then where is the app? Where is the

225
00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.370
Mark Pock: then, the the the thing that is what's like, as it were, transcendent, weird eminence.

226
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:06.809
Mark Pock: And who's who? Who? Sarah thought he could. He kind of could find it. In this notion of intuition of

227
00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:14.049
Mark Pock: especially with the notion of universality and necessity, it comes back over and over, using our universal necessary

228
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.740
Mark Pock: E day

229
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.650
Mark Pock: and

230
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:25.579
Mark Pock: but it. It's what we talked about. It's not clear that it can do that. You can get transcendence

231
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.779
Mark Pock: and that way.

232
00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:35.459
Mark Pock: because what we talked about in the class, and it was all different ways you could say, well, you thought this universal necessary is actually not turns out

233
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.470
Mark Pock: turns out like

234
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.759
Mark Pock: All of including geometry, is now been relatively

235
00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.980
Mark Pock: where they thought it was universally necessary.

236
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.740
Mark Pock: So maybe it's not in universal, and it says, now Hegel is actually trapped in that.

237
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:58.620
Mark Pock: So it's a German. But but actually not, it goes back to you. Don't remember It's in posture analytics

238
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.630
where he says, what is science? What is it?

239
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:10.379
Mark Pock: It's universal and necessary knowledge of things that are causes. because they all thought science was Euclid.

240
00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:15.809
Mark Pock: And you know all, any science should conform to that ideal in some way.

241
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:21.040
Mark Pock: so that's I don't know if that got to your question. But

242
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.929
Mark Pock: yeah last quick thing, and then, in like sort of he goes, narration of the history of philosophy.

243
00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:37.840
Mark Pock: Where does this in in relation to Khan? Is he like after, or sort of a similar notion. But okay, so

244
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:46.070
Mark Pock: it's okay, or it can go back to a letter. If it's option.

245
00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:54.810
Mark Pock: Yeah, let's come back. It's come back. But let's definitely come back, because there's actually a bigger story until that I'm waiting to sell.

246
00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.219
Mark Pock: okay.

247
00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.090
Mark Pock: there is another way of looking at this. Sure.

248
00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:07.579
Mark Pock: this is, I'm always looking at this. But of course it's just to one. Yeah, please.

249
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.189
Mark Pock: Kant said. We can't know this thing, and it's

250
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:17.420
Mark Pock: because we have our minds in our way of understanding things is

251
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:29.530
Mark Pock: made up, is determined, is, is, is made up of certain categories that we have in our mind as to how we perceive and how we make sense of the work

252
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.779
Mark Pock: and the the phenomena? Are they

253
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.929
Mark Pock: some manifold representations, etc.

254
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.130
Mark Pock: And he says in a.

255
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:47.009
Mark Pock: In a chapter in the Critique of Pure Reason, he talks about

256
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:55.989
Mark Pock: the meaning of the Numa. which is the thing in itself. and as opposed to the appearances that we have.

257
00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:06.389
Mark Pock: and as opposed to the concepts that we have through the categories that are that we have in our mind. He says that the reason that we

258
00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:12.979
Mark Pock: that there is all our mind is organized in such a way that we can only learn things through these categories.

259
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:23.820
Mark Pock: There might be things outside of these categories that we can't comprehend. And so he calls that  the numerator.

260
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.749
Mark Pock: He doesn't say that the new minute exists.

261
00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:36.860
Mark Pock: He says that we just don't have the ability to N necessarily understand it, because we have limits to our cognition.

262
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:42.239
Mark Pock: And so when you say, for example, where is the Absolute, which is

263
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.290
Mark Pock: he was gonna give his take on that.

264
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:49.770
Mark Pock: But where is the absolute in content in terms it just.

265
00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.040
Mark Pock: We don't know.

266
00:28:51.460 --> 00:29:09.159
Mark Pock: We don't know what that, even if there is an absolute, we just don't know. We only know with certain weight. There's only certain ways of knowing, and that's what we're limited to to and other way, other things that are out there. There could be other things outside of that that we just don't know. So for current.

267
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:22.770
Mark Pock: Thank you. Question of the new minute. It's an epistemological question rather than a ontological or metaphysical question. Sure, that's the whole idea. He wanted to limit knowledge, to make room for faith

268
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:31.890
Mark Pock: so that we can't know the absolute we can have a rational faith. and it's and

269
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:39.070
Mark Pock: on one so like the Neumann not literally means thought objects of the news.

270
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.809
Mark Pock: and a and a numer.

271
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.399
Mark Pock: I guess.

272
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:52.149
Mark Pock:  is we we can't know what it is. But we, we actually have to think it.

273
00:29:52.490 --> 00:30:06.509
Mark Pock: We have to think that there is something causing the appearances, even though we can never know what it is. And so yeah, caught. Yeah, he's saying that that's kind of his whole point is that we cannot know the absolute

274
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:15.000
Mark Pock: as absolute. And so that's the problem with all these scholastic, pre modern thinkers is that they thought they knew, and then they would fight over it.

275
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:22.870
Mark Pock: And he's so he's saying, Look, I'm limiting knowledge, I'm saying. Look, we, we can't know the absolute. We must think the Absolute

276
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:24.960
Mark Pock: as

277
00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:31.810
Mark Pock: an ultimate horizon. That explains all the appearances, but it can never be known, because anytime we would try to grasp it.

278
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.790
Mark Pock: It would be affected by the categories

279
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.859
Mark Pock: that are part of the faculty.

280
00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.040
Mark Pock:  the the mine.

281
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.650
Mark Pock: Yeah. So I think we're actually in that.

282
00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:56.590
Mark Pock: I was just saying. the question still persists, okay, where is the absolute conscious set as well? It's beyond.

283
00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.820
Mark Pock: We're separated from it by a bridge.

284
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:04.289
Mark Pock: and any attempt to cross the bridge will distort the object.

285
00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:11.220
Mark Pock: Now we have to positive we have to think the object cause we have to explain.

286
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.719
Mark Pock: give an account to ourselves as to how these appearances occur.

287
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:20.199
Mark Pock: but any attempt to to apply that to the thing will I our our concept of causality.

288
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.059
Mark Pock: which you cannot find in the object, as you had shown.

289
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:37.299
Mark Pock: And so, in order to just, we can't say it, we? We can't confidently say. The thing in itself causes all the appearances.

290
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:38.929
Mark Pock: but we have to think it does.

291
00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.989
Mark Pock: But how often the appearances

292
00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:50.500
Mark Pock: in the other piece here. We need the history when you time up

293
00:31:50.650 --> 00:32:07.679
Mark Pock: looking at philosophy in a historical way, and he's expressing this needs to be not situational exactly what he's saying, we have to take into account culture, timing impact of that time. And like. So when we look back, I find it really interesting to think.

294
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:23.930
Mark Pock: how did he define instruments? How did you define a representation? Because those terms have shifted dramatically right? And then it's it's that's where I have to get me. I go to etymology and say, Okay, that's what we think. How did it evolve?

295
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:45.149
Mark Pock: We're is Kant the first to say that those that in that space. There we have representations, but not the things themselves or the Absolute. Or is that already emerging from that? I mean, it's already emerging as a concept

296
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:46.520
Mark Pock: restriction

297
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.780
Mark Pock: on the possibility of moving beyond anything

298
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:54.150
Mark Pock: beyond mere representation and able to say.

299
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.259
Mark Pock: Yeah, we can

300
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.560
Mark Pock: kind of put down in my notes. He's really

301
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:15.479
Mark Pock: he. He doesn't like this idea of representations media. He wants to kind of us through that and kind of. But but but he's saying that if you don't bust through it. It's actually already present. But absolutely

302
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:20.389
Mark Pock: okay. The, the absolutely. Yeah. The very idea that there's something to bus through.

303
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:38.859
Mark Pock: Well, in that. In a process. Yeah, no, no, no, no. I. I said, yeah, for sure, for sure. yeah, that's so. The instrument, the other. The term that's interesting. Here's instrument. Yeah. Actually, I don't know if the German is there. but

304
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:50.269
Mark Pock: I think he's referring in a kind of generic sense to something like a content view of the mind as an instrument for reaching out literally

305
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:55.290
Mark Pock: a griffin to to grab hold of the absolute

306
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:59.120
Mark Pock: which begins with the child's experience of

307
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.699
Mark Pock: beings over there that lay my hands on okay and

308
00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.420
Mark Pock: And so.

309
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:20.479
Mark Pock: And of course, when I pick something up, I do and plant a little bit of myself, too. Right? So if I want to know how that is really in itself, I got to back away right. But then I'm still happy faculties in my mind that are shaping this thing. Okay?

310
00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:40.890
Mark Pock: And so, that's what he means by an instrument. Yeah, because it's I think of instrument also as evolving into a microscope where it's instructive because we're looking more at the thing itself. But you're looking. You're cutting through that hasn't quite taken hold in their minds. Right? It's yeah. Well, right? Sure. That's good.

311
00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.270
Mark Pock: right

312
00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:49.219
Mark Pock: no, no, that's I. What you might say is that

313
00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:50.780
Mark Pock: or Hegel. Yes.

314
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:56.519
Mark Pock: you could recover that term instrument and say, but the absolute is a self assembling instruments.

315
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:58.360
Mark Pock: Hmm, okay.

316
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:06.020
Mark Pock: and that it's it's not reaching out to anything other than itself to come to know itself. It's

317
00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.490
Mark Pock: becoming the absolute is

318
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:16.880
Mark Pock: is not something over there it's not something transcendent and it's forging itself.

319
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:22.579
Mark Pock:  if you want to like, I'm just trying to think this through like that would be a way to think about

320
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.389
Mark Pock: because what do you want to get.

321
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:28.750
Mark Pock: Because, of course, there's this organicism. And for Hegel there's a

322
00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.300
Mark Pock: content.

323
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:39.700
Mark Pock: These early models were to me they were. They were infected by mechanism and a lot of different ways, and thinking of instruments as these mechanical tools

324
00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:40.790
Mark Pock: that you would

325
00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:49.460
Mark Pock:  act upon, and that the universe itself was a kind of mechanism. This is the basic kind of early modern view of reality.

326
00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.910
Mark Pock: And

327
00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:58.470
Mark Pock: as opposed to something like an organic organic notion in which the

328
00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.830
Mark Pock: the tool itself assembles itself as it.

329
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:11.699
Mark Pock: But yeah, I don't know. Well, let me think about that a little more, too. But that's good. That's interesting. Yeah, because, like you're you're mentioning. Well.

330
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.580
Mark Pock: because what Hegel would probably say about like modern technology

331
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:25.309
Mark Pock: that's complicated. It's complicated because he would say, like E, those are just giving you. That's just immediacy.

332
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:33.530
Mark Pock: like the sense experience of like the macro is not qualitatively distinct from the sense experience of the micro

333
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.519
Mark Pock: All that has to be mediated by thought

334
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.210
Mark Pock: to get to the absolute.

335
00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:46.419
Mark Pock: Because, of course, you're not really seeing you're seeing all this things mediated by electrons and all this stuff you're not seeing

336
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:50.230
Mark Pock: like the microscopic as it is in itself.

337
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.060
Mark Pock: And so you could say, Well, I can never know it.

338
00:36:54.350 --> 00:37:06.019
Mark Pock: Yeah, you can think of like cause. That's literally what Con saying is like. These categories are like a microscope. But if you unpack the microscope, you can't get back to the thing that you supposedly we're supposed to see.

339
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:11.179
Mark Pock: but that you might be looking for the absolutely. What kind of things you're looking for the absolute in the wrong place.

340
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.059
Mark Pock: or he goes thing that

341
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.889
Mark Pock: and part of it is that you're looking for the absolute.

342
00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:20.130
Mark Pock: Hmm.

343
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:24.810
Mark Pock:  okay.

344
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:33.479
Mark Pock:  74. We'll read a couple more. But we'll get back to Andre.

345
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.350
Mark Pock: Question. Okay?

346
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:46.570
Mark Pock: Meanwhile, okay, so this is interesting. This is one of the one more famous passages. If the fear of falling into error, sets up a mistrust of science.

347
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:55.069
Mark Pock: which is the absence of such scruple, which, which, in the absence of such scruples, gets on with the work itself. and actually cognizes something.

348
00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:01.619
Mark Pock: It is hard to see why we should not turn around and mistrust this very mistrust that is mistrust costs very skepticism

349
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.710
Mark Pock: about knowing that the absolute

350
00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:11.909
Mark Pock: she would not be concerned as to whether this fear of error is not just the error itself.

351
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:18.049
Mark Pock: Indeed, this fear takes something a great deal, in fact, for granted as truth.

352
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:28.860
Mark Pock: this is the big thing. Tom's got all kinds of presuppositions, just as Descartes did. Oh, Descartes doubted everything that could be doubted. And then what do you know we're back to like 15 century

353
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:32.840
Mark Pock: late scholastic metaphysics. Okay.

354
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:39.579
Mark Pock: there's all kinds of presuppositions in these guys. And what Hegel is. Well, we'll get to that later.

355
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.489
Mark Pock: Indeed, this fear of something

356
00:38:44.380 --> 00:39:01.219
Mark Pock:  need this. Yeah. This fear of something takes a great deal, in fact, for granted. That's true. It's supporting it, scruples and inferences on what is itself in need of prior scrutiny to see if it is true. So it's it's supporting its doubt on this notion that the mind is a instrument

357
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:04.250
Mark Pock: without questioning whether that's what the mind is

358
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:12.930
Mark Pock:  to be specific, it takes for granted certain ideas about cognition as an instrument and as a medium.

359
00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:23.159
Mark Pock: and it assumes that there is a difference between ourselves and this cognition. above all, presupposes that the absolute stands on one side and a cognition on the other. The problem of the bridge.

360
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:31.920
Mark Pock: independent and separated from it, and yet is something real, or, in other words, it presupposes that cognition, which, since it is excluded from the absolute.

361
00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.610
Mark Pock: is surely outside of the truth as well.

362
00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:46.410
Mark Pock: is nevertheless true. So this is a this is a fundamental problem which is kind of saying his philosophy is true. It's a big deal, because he's saying this is absolutely true

363
00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.959
Mark Pock: that you cannot know the absolute

364
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:56.519
Mark Pock:  He's saying, this doesn't just appear to me, this is true.

365
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:16.529
Mark Pock: you might want to say, you, you might say, I'm not really saying that. But you people saying you you're saying that. But he's not, but he is. I think he is. Here's why, if we look at it from an epistemological point of view, he's saying

366
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:32.870
Mark Pock: we don't have in it. If we accept in our that we have categories of the mind if we accept that which Heckle doesn't eventually. But if we accept that any, it will be a different notion of category. But yeah.

367
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:40.430
Mark Pock: hey, go ahead. Hegel will say, that's give me. Kant says that we can't know the in itself.

368
00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:52.209
Mark Pock:  if there isn't in itself, there are things that might be beyond our ability to know things. There's a limit to what we, the categories are limited.

369
00:40:52.250 --> 00:41:02.930
Mark Pock: and if there is, if that there, we can't know everything, it could be things beyond our ability to understand our ability to yeah

370
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:08.589
Mark Pock: cognitively and embrace them. So if those things

371
00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:20.909
Mark Pock: he, he, he's making a statement that's almost a skeptical statement in the sense in my understanding my humble opinion. By the way, it's always

372
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:26.619
Mark Pock: that there could be things beyond our ability to know them.

373
00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.220
Mark Pock: And it's not

374
00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:34.629
Mark Pock: so. I think that's an epistemological, he said in a mythological boundary

375
00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:39.090
Mark Pock: he's in in, in the statement that well.

376
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:48.259
Mark Pock: we see these. We see these representations. And we then recognize these representations. They must have a cause.

377
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.770
Mark Pock: and that's the absolute.

378
00:41:52.530 --> 00:42:02.930
Mark Pock: But the problem is that the causation is a category cause. It affects the category, which is that we understand things to cause an effect. And

379
00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:11.560
Mark Pock: what if there is another category that's outside our ability to understand those kinds of relationships.

380
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:22.079
Mark Pock: And so when he says that it's an absolutely, can't absolutely can't know it, it's because we don't. Really, there may be things. It it. I think it's

381
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:27.159
Mark Pock: or friendly to say to God they may be things that we just don't know.

382
00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.949
Mark Pock: Sure. But what? Okay that. That's

383
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:35.570
Mark Pock: I would say I would I would agree with that

384
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:39.790
Mark Pock: But what Hegel is saying

385
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:49.049
Mark Pock: is he saying that he's still been saying, look, you're just. This is this instrument over here? That's the story, the Absolute.

386
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:53.600
Mark Pock: How would you know this? That that's the instrument.

387
00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:58.999
Mark Pock: presumably through the instrument? So are we into an infinite regress.

388
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.970
Mark Pock: But no, he's saying, no, this is the instrument.

389
00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:10.090
Mark Pock: This is true, this is what this is, not merely how knowledge appears to us. This is what knowledge is.

390
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.040
Mark Pock: and that's a contradiction.

391
00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.150
Mark Pock: That which is to say.

392
00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:32.069
Mark Pock: And this is a it's a relatively standard critique of many conscience, miss it, but it's not that controversial does Kant's account cost pistonology account for C.

393
00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.439
Mark Pock: What costs doing in the in the critique?

394
00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:43.120
Mark Pock: What he says about knowledge? Does it account for what Con is actually doing in the critique itself, which is to say, this is absolutely true of cognition.

395
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:47.389
Mark Pock: that cognition distorts its object.

396
00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:14.380
Mark Pock: Yes, good, please, please. What's the what is the like? Prehigalian, modern heuristic notion, the absolute, if not the totality that contains all these things like? Why is it that conscious striving they do have an absolutely just outside of the minds to be in. Well, he's not striving, he's saying, Don't strive.

397
00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:42.919
Mark Pock: Yeah, we're well, I guess. Like, well, where did the where did the idea of like God being in all people like the Holy Spirit? The modeling? Where does that idea? Well, it's been a. It's like you have gone is everything. Where do you have like identity? Go between like, then between 1,600 and hey, where does that? Just is it your off? Why do you walk and can't start talking about this great totality, and something which excludes us from it? or no, we've split ourselves from it for you? Why do we exclude ourselves from it

398
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:59.820
Mark Pock: of our own limited backs, like, why did that say keep saying that we're you so just like, why is that historically happened? Where is the moment where we stop thinking about the absolute has already been in each and every one of us for our sales is already being virtually well. The.

399
00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:05.779
Mark Pock: it seems like the the proximate context is the 30 Years War. The reformation of the 30 is worth

400
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:15.679
Mark Pock: okay? And what the the all, the modern. Starting with Descartes, it found a little bit earlier. We're saying you have. These scholastic philosophers talking about

401
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.360
Mark Pock: the absolute is, if they were standing next to it.

402
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:29.200
Mark Pock: that is, it was just there, but they they would all disagree about it. They couldn't settle their disputes, so, for example, them. So this is like

403
00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:36.110
Mark Pock: maybe less trivial, although for the early moderns, into the full enlightenment period which we were getting into now

404
00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:38.110
Mark Pock: and then, Hegel.

405
00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:52.790
Mark Pock:  the. These are all the same absurd questions whether you're talking about Angel wanna have a PIN Feces smelling in the afterlife? But also is Jesus present in the Eucharist.

406
00:45:53.660 --> 00:46:04.529
Mark Pock: which is the for the Catholic masses. The center of the mass is the thing around which the whole math or mass revolves. Is that is, yeah. Transistentiation substance

407
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:13.200
Mark Pock: does the substance of the. So here's back to the substance. Does the host become a different substance.

408
00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:22.990
Mark Pock: and by the priest doing the magic. the me sorry, the the miracle. Okay, it has a merit. Okay?

409
00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.160
Mark Pock: And

410
00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:35.699
Mark Pock:  And the Catholic said, yes, at least the Thomas, the Catholics from that would have taken over the termism of the late scholasticism.

411
00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.100
Mark Pock: And the

412
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.619
Mark Pock: Lutheran said, no, Luther said, No, the

413
00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:43.180
Mark Pock: the

414
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.910
What did he say it's symbolically present.

415
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:57.600
Mark Pock: Jesus is in both the President and the you, Chris, but not there. There's no transubstantiation. There's a certain presence. And then I think, Calvin said, there's no presence at all

416
00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:10.529
Mark Pock:  So the what? I don't actually, I can't remember what it is, because I I actually had a Calvin his friend that says, Yeah, we take this, we still take the egress. We drink the wine. But like.

417
00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:22.439
Mark Pock: we don't really think it's the real presence. It's the yeah, this is from the real presence of the Real Presence, because for strict Catholic theology, God is there in the Eucharist. Okay? And so they have these fights

418
00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:29.850
Mark Pock: and what the early modern. Okay, then you have this third thing called the 3 Years War, which is an apocalyptic confrontation.

419
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:40.659
Mark Pock: arguably worse than World war. 2  whole, like sections of Germany, were just wiped out like 50 of the population.

420
00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:46.700
Mark Pock:  tortures and murders beyond imagination.

421
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.900
Mark Pock: back and forth for 30 years. You mentioned that

422
00:47:50.130 --> 00:48:03.870
Mark Pock: just like half of Seattle gets wiped out by a torturous, bloody affair and just going keeps going on and on and on. Okay. And with these early modern, they they finally got over it. Okay. But the early modern Dayc was in the 30 years work.

423
00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:13.240
Mark Pock: He was in the first battle of the White Mountain. And he talks about it. He says, gosh, darn it, this is, they all say this is the beginning of

424
00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:14.900
Mark Pock: both the

425
00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:22.950
Mark Pock: discord, my method and discord on that. This goes on method and

426
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:31.970
Mark Pock: meditation is on first philosophy. He's like these scholastic one, shut up, and once, you know, we wind up in these endless wars that don't so.

427
00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:34.849
Mark Pock: and that's kind of the only way they can resolve their disputes.

428
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:44.070
Mark Pock: They cannot resolve them intellectually, because they're talking about things they cannot know about. They don't realize that  lots of the same thing.

429
00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.039
Mark Pock: Talk comes in human says same thing.

430
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:53.639
Mark Pock: and they all say, we're going to restart. We're going to start over. We're going to found things a new. This is the great Cartesian project we're going to start over

431
00:48:54.050 --> 00:49:02.259
Mark Pock: well, didn't work. Lots of knowing where I got this didn't work, he says, don't worry. I got this. Didn't work, so don't worry. I really, I got it this time.

433
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:08.779
Mark Pock: And so why, when did that happen?

434
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:14.079
Mark Pock: Well, it was yeah, it was kind of a it was, this is where politics and philosophy do

435
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.699
Mark Pock: kind of have an important overlaps here.

436
00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:22.059
Mark Pock: because there was this, this huge disillusionment

437
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:24.060
Mark Pock: with

438
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:27.270
Mark Pock: religion, they call it the wars of religion

439
00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.580
Mark Pock: and

440
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:40.019
Mark Pock: philosophy response. And of course there are other underlying currents like the new science mechanism and the idea that, like.

441
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:47.050
Mark Pock: you know, then you have, like Deism or God. Kind of is this, you know, abstract watchmaker, but is not really imminent

442
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:56.040
Mark Pock: in reality. and just S. The universe in motion, but then backs away. That kind of falls away. And then you're kind of yeah, you're just left with.

443
00:49:56.710 --> 00:50:02.990
Mark Pock:  no longer a sense. Yeah, that God is present in the in this world

444
00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:05.290
Mark Pock: that has left us

445
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:08.540
Mark Pock: as a editor, finally said.

446
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.930
Mark Pock: I don't know if that answer your question

447
00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:24.959
Mark Pock: so just as the historical piece that it's just like the same, actually as like a similar solution. And Bowling World War Ii, that it's so. It's it's it's generates. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would say, that's longer. Yeah.

448
00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:39.730
Mark Pock: But yeah, just the other part of my question is that in what sense isn't table just a rehab? Oh, oh, oh, just in what sense he's in table just to rehash this elastic ideas about God just being here. Yeah. So he thinks he is passing through this trauma

449
00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.430
Mark Pock: of maternity.

450
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:50.110
Mark Pock: and because what Hegel wants to say is, spirit does allow for this absolute alienation.

451
00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:57.459
Mark Pock: but then it reconciles. and that images of the reconciliation were already present

452
00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:01.190
Mark Pock: in Christian imagery. For example, Jesus

453
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:03.920
Mark Pock: going through death and coming out.

454
00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:09.879
Mark Pock: And so he's saying in modernity, yeah, there was this routing of

455
00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:12.680
Mark Pock: for the Absolute.

456
00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:22.040
Mark Pock: We're in the pretty free modern. They hadn't experienced that quite yet, although there, some of their images suggested that of course this thing

457
00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:30.810
Mark Pock: it's like this is spiraling upwards right? And so you have to pass through this modern philosophy where you're fully alienating from the absolutely.

458
00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:35.329
Mark Pock: and then reconcile, which is, makes it different then.

459
00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:40.829
Mark Pock: supposedly pre modern, where the Absolute was sort of naively accepted

460
00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:43.279
Mark Pock: as present.

461
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.790
Mark Pock: Now it's critically read.

462
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.060
Mark Pock: gathered.

463
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:58.040
Mark Pock: that would. That's what Hegel, like most general terms. How he would say, project is different than or not, just a rehash between the Supreme. It is a recovery of the pre-modern.

464
00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:02.349
Mark Pock: He's saying yes, because the Absolute never was over here.

465
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:06.989
Mark Pock: In fact, what you can say is, this, is the absolute

466
00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.470
Mark Pock: scared.

467
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.759
Mark Pock: and but it

468
00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.770
Mark Pock: it needs its essence

469
00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:19.130
Mark Pock: only to.

470
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:40.719
Mark Pock: Oh, very good question of how far away. Okay, but he's he's in authoritarianism of the church. But he did seem to retain the kernel. The main notion that you're talking about

471
00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:50.479
Mark Pock:  unless he's saying that it can happen, and it it maybe the person becomes we become. The mind is the instrument of the sphere becomes the instrument.

472
00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:56.260
Mark Pock: whereas in I was thinking of someone like Meister Echart or the the mystics who thought

473
00:52:56.490 --> 00:53:06.779
Mark Pock: they always had that unity presence. We're only needed from unity, and we'll only be there after death. Right? We'll only be there fast enough. But is Hegel making that

474
00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:08.090
Mark Pock: a

475
00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:19.400
Mark Pock: secular? Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, all right. But it's still steeped in the in this idea. Right? Yeah, that was the question. It's like, how far is he? Really?

476
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.340
Mark Pock: Yeah, I mean, there.

477
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:25.969
Mark Pock: Hegel, I mean, Heckart was the great German mystic, and he was.

478
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:30.560
Mark Pock: He had that yeah.

479
00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:32.330
Mark Pock: And

480
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:37.210
Mark Pock: spirit. It preserves itself even in that death.

481
00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:57.060
Mark Pock: Yeah, because they have mystics penetrate things by saying they actually have. Yes, yeah. And what Hegel is saying, we can be on that mysticism to rational conceptual grass of the absolutely. The categories are not tools. They are the thing.

482
00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:23.190
Mark Pock: okay, let's oh, sorry. Go ahead.

483
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:37.019
Mark Pock: I don't want to be. No, please. I was, you know, I can't get thinking I'm new here. Okay, so up there's not anything. The first time around. We're all just new here, too. But then there's the the other connection is Hume and Kant.

484
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:38.439
Mark Pock: In what? That

485
00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.550
Mark Pock: the huge notion that you can't see cause and effect.

486
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:53.560
Mark Pock: you know Billy Ball hits another bill. You. You don't see the calls. In effect, you see 1 billion bob moving in another bill. So Cohen agrees with that. You don't see that.

487
00:54:53.680 --> 00:55:12.519
Mark Pock: So where is this causing effect? And then he comes up with this notion of categories, which is a different way of looking at the world as opposed to world looking at the world as you start with objects in the world, especially in organic conflicts in the world. And then you try to figure him out scientifically, let's say.

488
00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:30.050
Mark Pock: But here he's saying that all this is in your mind. The the constant effect is in your mind. That's a whole new. you know, twist. and then starts off on the thing. Well, if that's why our mind is structured, then we can't go the absolute. So it's a

489
00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.349
Mark Pock: what what's that next

490
00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:36.039
Mark Pock: that Brooklyn.

491
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:51.070
Mark Pock: I'm from Boston. But I was married to a woman from Brooklyn for 19 years. Really, yeah, which destroys anybody's ability to talk like a regularly

492
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:55.880
Mark Pock: wow, yeah. Interesting.

493
00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:03.190
Mark Pock:  okay. Well. yeah. Anyway, let's

494
00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:04.710
Mark Pock: So what he says.

495
00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:14.539
Mark Pock: it presupposes that cognition, which is which, since it is, it is excluded from the Abs, and it is surely outside the truth as well. It's never the less true

496
00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:21.020
Mark Pock: an assumption whereby what calls itself fear of error reveals itself rather as fear of the truth.

497
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:29.580
Mark Pock: This conclusion stems from the fact that the absolute alone is true. for the truth alone is absolutely.

498
00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:35.730
Mark Pock: which is what? This is a big thing. Okay, this is enormous, because what is being said here is

499
00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:40.440
Mark Pock: what's the criterion for

500
00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.610
Mark Pock: knowing

501
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:47.440
Mark Pock: the absolute for for Kant. What is it?

502
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:52.250
Mark Pock: And but if it, if we could know, how would we know it

503
00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.890
Mark Pock: to our mind through immediate intuition?

504
00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:09.039
Mark Pock: Yeah, but we can't do that, because anything that's given to us an intuition is distorted. Okay? But sense sensuition, tuition

505
00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:17.670
Mark Pock: immediacy is the ideal of knowledge for content. he said. We can't get it. And so, therefore we can't know the absolute

506
00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:25.099
Mark Pock: Hegel is saying, no, the criterion for knowing the absolute is not sensuous intuition. It's truth.

507
00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:29.000
Mark Pock: What is true is what is absolute.

508
00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:34.999
Mark Pock: And so when Kant says that it is true that the mind is this way.

509
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:46.560
Mark Pock: that's what he's saying. You're then you're saying, that's what's absolute. So you have to. You have to shift your cr. This is the whole thing we'll get into. When the progressions of forms of consciousness. They have different criteria of truth.

510
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:49.380
Mark Pock: but make something true. Hmm.

511
00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:54.469
Mark Pock: and for and what and that by which one knows the absolute.

512
00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.130
Mark Pock: for he has an ideal of truth which

513
00:57:57.410 --> 00:58:01.500
Mark Pock: we saw. It's who Serrell does not fully overcome.

514
00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:03.120
Mark Pock: which is that

515
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:08.349
Mark Pock: the Absolute must be given an immediate intuition on

516
00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:11.530
Mark Pock: which is what? okay.

517
00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:18.230
Mark Pock:  that is that is that that appearance.

518
00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.690
Mark Pock: anyway? It's shining.

519
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:26.950
Mark Pock: Yeah.

520
00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:34.569
Mark Pock: yes, Joe. But actually

521
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:39.390
Mark Pock: it. It's because, you know, I can get like converted.

522
00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:43.600
Mark Pock: The is actually so you say.

523
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:49.449
Mark Pock: look, look over there. but it is your origin of our show.

524
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:58.480
Mark Pock: So that's where it can sound like an appearance, but it's actually on sound, which is to say, looking into something.

525
00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.479
Mark Pock: And so

526
00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.410
Mark Pock: for

527
00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:09.220
Mark Pock:  haunt and for him

528
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:16.360
Mark Pock:  the ideal of objectivity is looking

529
00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:17.610
Mark Pock: on show.

530
00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:23.100
Mark Pock: and all they say is, you can't get the object in itself through looking.

531
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:31.579
Mark Pock: Hegel says, that's not how you know the ups. You know the absolute, not through looking, but through knowing the true.

532
00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:37.739
Mark Pock: Okay, so the question is, what's the criterion for for knowing? Is it on show.

533
00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:42.279
Mark Pock: or is the truth. and there's also a gradations in between there.

534
00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:52.529
Mark Pock: But that's a that's a fundamental thing. This is. I'm getting a little bit of a longer gaming thing in the background here. But it's clear right here from Hegel that you have to. You have to learn to

535
00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:55.839
Mark Pock: overcome the naive presupposition that

536
00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.669
Mark Pock: to know being is to to have it given to you. An intuition

537
01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:07.229
Mark Pock: rather than to know being, is to know the true that actually goes back to a pre modern notion, which is the idea of the

538
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:11.880
Mark Pock:  the convertibility.

539
01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:17.440
Mark Pock: This is the old notion of the transport vert ability of the transcendentals.

540
01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.450
Mark Pock: This is a

541
01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:32.010
Mark Pock: fundamentals. These are the original categories. modern categories. a true

542
01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:34.170
Mark Pock: good

543
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:36.960
Mark Pock: being

544
01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:39.760
Mark Pock: beautiful.

545
01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.769
Mark Pock: And you asked about simplicity to this

546
01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:46.850
Mark Pock: simplicity or unit team.

547
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:51.770
Mark Pock: And

548
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:58.579
Mark Pock: okay, what this is the this is the last of you. Which is it? Because what they were saying is, they had this notion. Okay.

549
01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:02.719
Mark Pock: metaphysics was the.

550
01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:08.410
Mark Pock: And so what they? What they said is, okay. What does it? What must some? What? What was something

551
01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:10.160
Mark Pock: be in order to be?

552
01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.830
Mark Pock: That is what are the one of the most. So, for example, like, if you go up

553
01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.649
Mark Pock:  this is the. This is the hierarchy of

554
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.349
Mark Pock: the sort of Aristotelian

555
01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:28.860
Mark Pock:  low chart. Okay? So you have, like, you know.

556
01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:30.760
Mark Pock: different individuals.

557
01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:38.450
Mark Pock: bread and James, hey? And then you have human right. But you can also have

558
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:41.470
Mark Pock: of a you know, an 8.

559
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:44.809
Mark Pock: So you don't have to be in hate in order to be

560
01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:47.490
Mark Pock: yeah.

561
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.420
Mark Pock: But so that category is

562
01:01:51.760 --> 01:02:00.770
Mark Pock: not universal or necessary in order to be, you don't have to be in a but in order to be, you do have to be.

563
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:07.049
Mark Pock: And for the traditional philosophy you had to be good

564
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:10.990
Mark Pock: and also beautiful.

565
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:15.190
Mark Pock: and you have to be one thing.

566
01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:23.960
Mark Pock: that is to say, mere diffusion as such is doesn't exist. That would be pure potency.

567
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:29.360
Mark Pock: If any anything to exist, it must be. What can that be unified in some way?

568
01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:33.559
Mark Pock: There's another thing. It's just just that.

569
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.669
Mark Pock: Show me black.

570
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:42.459
Mark Pock: It has to have. Actually, you is actually a criterion for me.

571
01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:49.230
Mark Pock: And but here's the thing true also. This is, think, if it's assign it. B. It must be true, then it.

572
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:55.619
Mark Pock: which is to say that being in truth are convertible, not on challenge.

573
01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.400
Mark Pock: And so then the question of what is true.

574
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:05.490
Mark Pock: But this is

575
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:06.630
Mark Pock: famously

576
01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:11.690
Mark Pock: when they talk about medium. This is what this is, the things. This is what this is.

577
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:13.540
Mark Pock: Truth was the medium.

578
01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:22.379
Mark Pock: It was called like end, mediocre, or something that by which the beating is known. But the point is that they're not 2 different things.

579
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.120
Mark Pock: They're they're convertible.

580
01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.239
Mark Pock: Truth and being are convertible.

581
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.950
Mark Pock: anyway, that's kind of sorry. That was kind of maybe good about that. That's

582
01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:38.860
Mark Pock: that's just so, you know that that's the part of the background of the content notion of

583
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:44.260
Mark Pock: the categories. These are the original transcendentals, because transcendental here, just and

584
01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.650
Mark Pock: transcending any particular category.

585
01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.500
Mark Pock: What for all things must possess

586
01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:53.460
Mark Pock: goodness being beauty in order to be.

587
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:58.380
Mark Pock: and but it's important that truth is there too, because truth

588
01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:03.880
Mark Pock: is that by which being is known. and that's true for pre-modern.

589
01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:09.230
Mark Pock: although not all of them, because you have you go back and find. Actually there were these

590
01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.649
Mark Pock: on sound

591
01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.699
Mark Pock: in like

592
01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:28.179
Mark Pock: all throughout lost. It repeats again and again this notion that you're gonna if you want to find the absolute, you have to find it an immediate, sensuous intuition. You constantly just get disappointed that it's not actually there. And then you say, Okay, then it can't be known.

593
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.599
Mark Pock: Instead of saying, maybe my criterion for knowing is is the problem.

594
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:41.130
Mark Pock: Okay? Last little last little session here.

595
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:48.670
Mark Pock: and then actually, we'll do I what do you want to get back to your question about? So? Because I got one little thing to say, but let's finish one or 2 more of these barriers.

596
01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:57.689
Mark Pock: This, this, this conclusion comes from the fact that the absolute alone is true, or truth alone is absolute

597
01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:04.420
Mark Pock: when they set this aside on the grounds. If there's a type of cognition which, though it does not recognize the absolute as science teams to

598
01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:18.449
Mark Pock:  is still true, and that cognition in general, though it is incapable of grasping the absolute, still capable of grasping other kinds of truth. This is Kant, that you can, that you can grasp truth of the phenomenal world.

599
01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:20.790
Mark Pock: but not truth, truth.

600
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:31.409
Mark Pock: But we gradually come to see that this kind of talk which goes back and forth only leads to a hazy distinction between the absolute truth and some other kind of truth.

601
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:38.549
Mark Pock: and the words, like absolute cognition, etc. presuppose a meeting which is not has yet to be ascertained.

602
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:46.420
Mark Pock:  yeah, we could probably see that.

603
01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:50.649
Mark Pock: Probably stop there, I guess.

604
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:59.110
Mark Pock: hopefully, I may help you guys getting through the rest of the Oh, there's one big thing

605
01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:02.190
Mark Pock: we'll get to that. Maybe I'll write something about this for you guys

606
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:06.960
Mark Pock: for because it's it's kind of a big topic. For in in paragraphs

607
01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:14.300
Mark Pock: 78 starting, it's a big thing. Because this this

608
01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.280
Mark Pock: let me actually see?

609
01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:23.140
Mark Pock: Actually, yeah, a little bit further down

610
01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:37.259
Mark Pock:  okay, so this is okay. So this is a

611
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:48.109
Mark Pock:  where he's so where he starts to talk about the problem of the criterion. So the problem with the criterion

612
01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:54.810
Mark Pock: he knows paradox. the whole idea of do we have a criterion that can test itself?

613
01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:02.800
Mark Pock:  and so he says, I'll just read it really quick and 81 and 82. I'm just going to read through it.

614
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:09.460
Mark Pock: So, in addition to these preliminary general remarks about the manner and necessity of the progression. Blah blah blah

615
01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:14.289
Mark Pock:  It is this.

616
01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:28.949
Mark Pock: If this exposition is viewed as a way of relating science to phenomenal knowledge, and as an investigation and examination of the reality of cognition, it would seem that it cannot take place without some presupposition we can which can serve as the underlying criterion.

617
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:31.729
Mark Pock: It's a who.

618
01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:34.370
Mark Pock: for a proof in in German.

619
01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:36.079
Mark Pock: but needs to prove itself

620
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:49.549
Mark Pock: for an examination consistent applying an accepted standard and determining whether something is right or wrong on the basis of the resulting agreement or disagreement of the thing examined. It's a standard as such, and science likewise, if it were, the criterion.

621
01:07:50.270 --> 01:08:01.080
Mark Pock: is accepted as the essence or as the thing in itself. But here, where science has just begun to come on the scene. Neither the science or anything else is justified itself as the essence.

622
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:07.390
Mark Pock: and and without something of the sort it seems that no examination can take place.

623
01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:14.220
Mark Pock: You don't know the criterion by which we're going to judge everything else. Now, how are we going to know that we're even going in the right direction.

624
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:26.609
Mark Pock: This contradiction and its removal will become more definite if we call to mind the abstract or terminations of truth and knowledge is the current conscious consciousness simultaneously distinguishes itself from something. Okay. This is the big, the.

625
01:08:27.609 --> 01:08:39.549
Mark Pock: and at the same time relates itself to it. Or, as it is said, this something exists for consciousness. and the determined aspect of this relating of, or of the being of something, for consciousness is knowing.

626
01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:49.980
Mark Pock: But we distinguish this being for another from being in itself. That is the same con just did that for us the thing in itself versus its appearance.

627
01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:58.769
Mark Pock: Whatever is related to knowledge or knowing, is also distinguished from it, and positive as existing outside this relationship.

628
01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:01.810
Mark Pock: This being in itself is called truth.

629
01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:11.559
Mark Pock: Just what might be involved in this these determinations is of no further concern to us here, since our object is phenomenal knowledge, determination to blah blah blah.

630
01:09:11.859 --> 01:09:19.500
Mark Pock: Now, if we inquire into the truth of knowledge. It seems that we are asking what knowledge in itself is, hey? That's what I was just talking about, right

631
01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:28.109
Mark Pock: to be talking about what knowledge in itself is yet in this inquiry knowledge is our object, something that exists for us.

632
01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:38.940
Mark Pock: so we just distorting it and coming to know what it is. and the in itself that would supposedly result from it would rather be the being of knowledge for us. And then we're in an infinite regress.

633
01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:46.050
Mark Pock: What we assert it to be, its essence would be no. not so much. It's truth, but rather just our knowledge of it.

634
01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.239
Mark Pock: Yes, since our criterion would lie outside within ourselves.

635
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:58.420
Mark Pock: and that which was to be compared with it, and about which a decision would be reached. Through this comparison it would not necessarily have to recognize the validity of such a standard.

636
01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:00.300
Mark Pock: That's the problem with comparison.

637
01:10:02.130 --> 01:10:03.590
Mark Pock: Okay, now, here's the thing.

638
01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:11.039
Mark Pock: But the dissociation or the the semblance of the dissociation

639
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:23.320
Mark Pock: and presupposition is overcome by the nature of the object we are interested in. Consciousness provides its own criterion from within itself. so that the investigation becomes a comparison of consciousness with itself.

640
01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:29.140
Mark Pock: or, in other words, no comparison at all. or the distinction made above falls within it.

641
01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:36.030
Mark Pock: that is to say, the distinction between the being in itself versus the being for us falls within consciousness.

642
01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:38.760
Mark Pock: Yeah.

643
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:42.549
Mark Pock: And consciousness. One thing exists for another.

644
01:10:43.760 --> 01:11:03.759
Mark Pock: I consciousness regularly. It contains the determinations of the moment of knowledge. At the same time, this other is consciousness, not merely for it is to conscious, it is not really for, but it's also outside of this relationship existing in itself the moment of truth. Thus, and what questions the firms from within itself as being in itself, or the true, we have the standard which consciousness itself, consciousness itself sets up

645
01:11:04.290 --> 01:11:06.150
Mark Pock: by which to measure what it knows.

646
01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:09.340
Mark Pock: If we distinguish knowledge as the notion.

647
01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:12.229
Mark Pock: but the essence or the true as what exists.

648
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:15.269
Mark Pock: Okay. So then he goes on and say, you can just

649
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:30.179
Mark Pock: the step. So consciousness provides its own. Essentially, what he's saying is, consciousness provides some standard. and drawing this distinction between being merely for it and being for itself, that is, or being in itself, that

650
01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:36.250
Mark Pock: distinction falls within consciousness, so that you don't have to compare something outside of consciousness.

651
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:42.429
Mark Pock: in order to know whether or not you know the object. Consciousness

652
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:49.510
Mark Pock: has already self made the distinction in some sense overcome the distinction, because it just is itself

653
01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:54.790
Mark Pock: in the distinction. let me see if I can say it better.

654
01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:59.590
Mark Pock:  If we doesn't acknowledge as the notion.

655
01:12:00.570 --> 01:12:07.810
Mark Pock: But this is true of what exists on the object and the examination consist, and seeing whether the notion corresponds to the object. But if you call the essence, or the in itself, or the

656
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:12.650
Mark Pock: of the object, the notion, and then the the other hand, understand the object

657
01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:20.420
Mark Pock: the notion itself as objects. This one, then the examinations is what it is evident, of course, that the 2 procedures are the same.

658
01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:28.620
Mark Pock: but the essential point to bear in mind throughout the whole investigation is that these 2 moments notion in objects so notion, there is concept

659
01:12:29.530 --> 01:12:34.709
Mark Pock: an object so cons categories. and the object.

660
01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:40.620
Mark Pock: the thing in itself, and being for another, and being in itself both fall within that knowledge we are investigating.

661
01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:53.940
Mark Pock: Consequently we do not need to import criteria to make our use of our own bright ideas and thoughts during the course of the inquiry is precisely when we leave these aside that we succeed in contemplating the matter in hand as it is in for itself.

662
01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:07.839
Mark Pock: That's the that's the crucial. It's the core of the whole thing. Yeah. Consciousness provides its own criterion.

663
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:15.270
Mark Pock: it should be discussed.

664
01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:18.739
Mark Pock: I'm not sure it's notion of imminent criterion.

665
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:23.580
Mark Pock: Okay? And the point being is that when Kant does this

666
01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:27.570
Mark Pock: made it, the

667
01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:30.859
Mark Pock: thinking about. It's in his consciousness.

668
01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:36.280
Mark Pock: That's

669
01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.590
Mark Pock: what's that?

670
01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.919
Mark Pock: Our

671
01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.470
Mark Pock: if Con is describing how our mind works.

672
01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:58.899
Mark Pock: I guess. But something. So what's that one that's please. I am sorry. No, no, we're not. I'm saying I

673
01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:05.090
Mark Pock: because of the we we talk about, because this is the problem with comparison. Right?

674
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:09.810
Mark Pock: How do you know that you have the thing itself to compare to your knowledge of it?

675
01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.460
Mark Pock: It's presumably

676
01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.569
Mark Pock: your knowledge that knowing this

677
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:16.820
Mark Pock: and so

678
01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:23.009
Mark Pock:  but the question, okay, another way of thinking about this. Have you ever known anything? That was true?

679
01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.310
Mark Pock: Okay, how did you know that?

680
01:14:31.410 --> 01:14:37.430
Mark Pock: And if you were to say. Well, I had. I looked over here the thing that I knew, and it my knowledge of it.

681
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:45.959
Mark Pock:  There's that's that's just incoherent, because you just presumably you know that this is the thing.

682
01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.880
Mark Pock: All right. Hmm.

683
01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:52.410
Mark Pock: so there must be an imminent criterion.

684
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:55.610
Mark Pock: Knowledge cannot be comparison

685
01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.049
Mark Pock: of the criterion with the thing.

686
01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:20.779
Mark Pock: I I it feels I keep getting up pulled back to 77 and other parts for now, because to me, what's missing? Because I don't quite comprehend that is the process like, and it's like.

687
01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:32.670
Mark Pock: because he talks about the path of the natural consciousness which presses toward to knowledge and sort of the spirit of inquiry is the reason. It's not just the criterion. It's the fact that our minds

688
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:51.909
Mark Pock: and I can't. You know I have never come to a truth without a process. So that's not with the criterion discussion. I don't feel the process part. But is that just? That's the evolution of the the criterion, in some sense is the criterion of the process. It's the sort of the thing that it's the kick off. Yeah, it guides it.

689
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.229
Mark Pock: Yeah, it's it's

690
01:15:54.370 --> 01:16:02.920
Mark Pock: cause you you're anticipating already the end in the beginning. It's that very dynamism

691
01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:11.770
Mark Pock: that's that's a big word dynamic. He talks about it. It's because it's the same word as he could translate as potency. Dynamism

692
01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:14.630
Mark Pock: is

693
01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.369
Mark Pock: the it's motion

694
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:22.199
Mark Pock: towards the end. But it's not just like

695
01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:24.730
Mark Pock: it's not merely it's dynamic.

696
01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:32.529
Mark Pock: So the the criterion is dynamic. It's not just the state of rest. So it's just sitting there. It's anticipating an end.

697
01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:35.640
Mark Pock: So. And again for me.

698
01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:37.119
Mark Pock: this is where just the

699
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:42.419
Mark Pock: the money isn't monitoring because you can just go. Have you ever asked the question?

700
01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:47.110
Mark Pock: That's the imminent Cr, the imminent criterion is a dynamic anticipation.

701
01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:50.640
Mark Pock: It doesn't quite have that clear phenomenology

702
01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:52.910
Mark Pock: of questioning, for example.

703
01:16:53.130 --> 01:17:07.160
Mark Pock: So he's gonna still, he's he's he's aware of it. He he hasn't quite gotten there yet, either. And so he's going to talk about this imminent criterion is kind of work around it, but he'll have a general. It's it's it's actually more or less.

704
01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:11.429
Mark Pock: It's an notion that there's a kind of imminent.

705
01:17:12.010 --> 01:17:14.290
Mark Pock: Tell us an imminent tendency

706
01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:15.910
Mark Pock: that

707
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:21.429
Mark Pock: can judge whether or not the thing that it anticipates has satisfied hit.

708
01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:24.279
Mark Pock: because what it turns out

709
01:17:25.410 --> 01:17:29.590
Mark Pock: for for longing and for a

710
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:32.119
Mark Pock:  hey? Go

711
01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:38.530
Mark Pock: the ultimate criterion. How you know you've got the absolute. Are you satisfied?

712
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:48.560
Mark Pock: Are you satisfied? I'm not sense. But notice, okay, you got that criteria in you.

713
01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:58.200
Mark Pock: does he say that across all beings? Because, let's say, spirit is in

714
01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:01.009
Mark Pock: all of us that we have the same criterion.

715
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:07.430
Mark Pock: Yeah, I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, he's a good

716
01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:17.649
Mark Pock: kind of job of the enlightenment that this is a a universal truth of all humanity. one spirit

717
01:18:20.170 --> 01:18:29.740
Mark Pock: The differences are explicable. has moments in the unfolding and the fact that you know

718
01:18:30.150 --> 01:18:38.120
Mark Pock:  because, like what he'll say is, you could just it's there in K. He's already got it. He just doesn't quite see what he's got.

719
01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:40.470
Mark Pock: because the the Absolute is already there.

720
01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:49.960
Mark Pock: and the but it's not yet forkant. The absolute is income. But it's obviously at 4 con. I see, and that's happening all the time everywhere for everyone

721
01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:53.850
Mark Pock: different cultures.

722
01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:57.629
Mark Pock: and then there's then there's hang on.

723
01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:06.810
Mark Pock: But so you would say that. Yeah, there's a you know, there's a kind of a universal going pre-human.

724
01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:28.199
Mark Pock: He's a tiny bit ethnocentric, though. Right? I mean, oh, yeah, I mean, we. He didn't actually go into the history of philosophy. Like the actual cause he starts with like supposedly pre philosophical traditions in the East, and he talks about like he says, like

725
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:33.840
Mark Pock: he even has biases like in favor of like Greece and Rome like. Oh, he says it.

726
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:37.830
Mark Pock: you want okay and ready for some. you ready.

727
01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:43.469
Mark Pock: So in China only one person is free to the Emperor, increase. Many are free.

728
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:44.960
Mark Pock: but there's still slaves.

729
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:51.750
Mark Pock: and then only in modern Germany. Russia is everyone free now.

730
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:57.629
Mark Pock: But here's the thing he totally doesn't understand the real horror of slavery, and

731
01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:07.799
Mark Pock: it was not what he thought. It was like. The whole, like democracy like we talk about. This is the birthplace of the that's a complete illusion like the the Demos was not

732
01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:11.720
Mark Pock: what we think of as like United

733
01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.170
Mark Pock: equals.

734
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:20.759
Mark Pock: it was a completely like that. He's looking at everything. Speaking of his own, he's looking at a post Christian.

735
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:22.690
Mark Pock: specifically Protestant

736
01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:27.009
Mark Pock: projection backwards on all of history.

737
01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:36.990
Mark Pock: But of course. Then he so he ratifies that through the very narrative, you know.  so

738
01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:44.609
Mark Pock: yeah, like he's it's totally, I mean, we know all kinds of things that he just didn't know about cultural changes in the way

739
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:50.679
Mark Pock: Greek society was nothing like what an eighteenth century nineteenth century German Stock Creek Society function like.

740
01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.940
Mark Pock: which is great, you know, like we should be doing that.

741
01:20:54.190 --> 01:21:00.340
Mark Pock:  But you know the question is that okay? Then do we throw out all of him.

742
01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:02.880
Mark Pock: you know, or do we say.

743
01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:14.790
Mark Pock: there's actually maybe something there in the sense that like, okay, like you said, I'm not satisfied. Well, Hegel is going to say, Okay, good. That. Notice that.

744
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:18.030
Mark Pock: and sometimes even about Hegel himself.

745
01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:23.550
Mark Pock: and maybe that will Brok draw you actually closer to what Hegel is trying to get at.

746
01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:29.730
Mark Pock: It seems to me that between 70,

747
01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:34.330
Mark Pock: 6, and 80

748
01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:42.650
Mark Pock: bye. the end of 84 there is, one or 2

749
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:55.560
Mark Pock: not more logical leaps. Oh, it was a lot of them. And so what would seem to me, and I'd be doing this myself to go over them and see where he's making these logical leaps.

750
01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:59.000
Mark Pock: because he's just going from

751
01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:21.930
Mark Pock: at this age. Old problem that is mystified all these people, and then 3 day to see solved it. I just think that it would be interesting to and and I'll do that for myself. Surely you seem to like parse that one. Well, 2 things. One is an introduction. So it's not quite yet the argument itself. Yeah, kind of telling you where you think he's going to go

752
01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:26.129
Mark Pock: to. There is a paper on this. It's called. You can't get there from here

753
01:22:26.210 --> 01:22:42.369
Mark Pock: by this guy named Robert Pippin. You can't. You can't get there from here that you can't get to work. Cable says I just got here from here. You can't actually get there. But it's a tip in this great vehicles color.

754
01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:43.470
Mark Pock: I

755
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:48.090
Mark Pock: my heavy critical about 99% of tipping. But

756
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:49.660
Mark Pock: that's a good. It's a good essay.

757
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:54.400
Mark Pock: Yeah, I mean you. You can check it out if you want, I pretty sure you can get easy access to it.

758
01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:59.050
Mark Pock: I'm pretty sure you can get. Probably you don't have access to the article.

759
01:22:59.070 --> 01:23:02.409
Mark Pock: You can't get there from here. Yeah, if you want to check it out.

760
01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.649
Mark Pock: So that's I think that's along the lines of what you're saying is that

761
01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:14.340
Mark Pock: that's but that's in the phenomenon that's actually in the phenomenal, even in this argument, not even just in the introduction. The whole thing you you can't get there from here.

762
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:33.440
Mark Pock: If you have like, universal like, where does the

763
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:41.400
Mark Pock: the singularity or the

764
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:46.959
Mark Pock: it's the singular? Yeah. I like, when when does this angles like? Very like

765
01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.929
Mark Pock: suggestion of the

766
01:23:59.010 --> 01:24:00.890
Mark Pock: that's

767
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:10.590
Mark Pock: yeah. Well, I mean, what is, what does he say is, it's internal to conscious, imminent internal criterion. Yeah, how does it? How does the where does the internal, what? What are like?

768
01:24:11.230 --> 01:24:12.050
Oh.

769
01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.539
Mark Pock: I I would simply give you one. Yes.

770
01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.990
Mark Pock: look into that.

771
01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:26.599
Mark Pock: Yeah. Well, okay. So the like, I said the first thing, and I you know this may never.

772
01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.890
Mark Pock: It clicks for me.

773
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.500
Mark Pock: but it may not for anyone else. But both

774
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:41.389
Mark Pock: laundering would say this more, but Hegel would also basically say the same thing. I I think you would say

775
01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.070
Mark Pock: you notice your own notes, your own

776
01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:50.499
Mark Pock: question right? There, what are you demanding?

777
01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:55.860
Mark Pock: Okay.

778
01:24:57.230 --> 01:25:04.250
Mark Pock: yeah. So like you're you, there's something you're doing. You're setting. You're saying, I I want this thing.

779
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:06.750
Mark Pock: I want to know this thing.

780
01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:11.270
Mark Pock: and I I in that very question.

781
01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:15.539
Mark Pock: is that kind of expectation that there is something that will satisfy it.

782
01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:21.770
Mark Pock: and that you'll know when you're when it's satisfied.

783
01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:23.930
Mark Pock: asking what?

784
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:27.419
Mark Pock: I don't know. What is a man?

785
01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:32.020
Mark Pock: You? It's from you. You have a demand inside you and asking my question.

786
01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:36.949
Mark Pock: I don't. Yeah, it's not. It's not it. It doesn't.

787
01:25:38.230 --> 01:25:40.989
Mark Pock: I mean it, doesn't it?

788
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:51.249
Mark Pock: Oh, I wasn't I? That wasn't my definitive response. That was just to say that the first thing that Hegel would want you to notice

789
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:58.460
Mark Pock: or try to notice if it's really there. Is that  

790
01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:07.699
Mark Pock: Because part of this is as he says, this is about experience. This whole thing is phenomenology of the experience of consciousness. That's actually the subtle of the book.

791
01:26:08.170 --> 01:26:19.849
Mark Pock: It's the phenomenology of the experience. So what he's saying is, you have to. All this is, yeah. There are arguments here. but yet, but there's a more fundamental task which is to to advert to your own experience.

792
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:26.070
Mark Pock: and part of that would be the experience of the mind setting up its own criterion

793
01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:29.409
Mark Pock: in doing things like asking questions.

794
01:26:30.730 --> 01:26:33.540
Mark Pock: Now. So

795
01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:44.220
Mark Pock: having said that, could you actually remind me what you? The precise nature of your question was

796
01:26:46.110 --> 01:26:48.379
that was interesting? it goes

797
01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:53.660
Mark Pock: resolution.

798
01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:56.820
Mark Pock: Yeah.

799
01:26:57.010 --> 01:26:59.070
Mark Pock: Question. So

800
01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:03.110
Mark Pock: so let's go. Yeah.

801
01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:05.700
Mark Pock: yes, I.

802
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:08.830
Mark Pock: But When does that?

803
01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:13.949
Yes,

804
01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:20.789
Mark Pock: And and what I'm saying is, okay, there's 2 again. There's it's almost like 2 things happening simultaneously. There's like.

805
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:22.200
Mark Pock: there's like

806
01:27:23.230 --> 01:27:26.360
Mark Pock: the well, okay, one. First of all.

807
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:33.359
Mark Pock:  none of us have to accept any anything. Hail

808
01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:39.580
Mark Pock: right? Right and I and so if we're talking about like

809
01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:47.030
Mark Pock:  what Hegel claims to be the kind of the universal scope of what he's

810
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:48.990
Mark Pock: his his for a project

811
01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:57.579
Mark Pock: or his argument.

812
01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:07.900
Mark Pock: What to what extent is like? When is when this is

813
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:15.150
Mark Pock: well, it's always been. There's only ever been spirit spirit all the way down

814
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:19.560
Mark Pock: for hang on. But but there's always spirit.

815
01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:24.109
Mark Pock: the spirit in itself. And then there's the reports of from the minister in and for itself.

816
01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:27.980
Mark Pock: So nature, nature of spirit and

817
01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:35.310
Mark Pock:  And then you have

818
01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:40.349
Mark Pock: well, what is here for itself in some sense, that's that's just

819
01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:43.740
Mark Pock: ultra in the mind. I mean. It's sort of

820
01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.959
Mark Pock: humanity prior to hang off.

821
01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:57.600
Mark Pock: It's because it's nate is. But it. But notice that spirit has spirit is always for itself.

822
01:28:58.050 --> 01:29:03.740
Mark Pock: So even though nature is spirit in itself, spirit is always for itself, so nature is.

823
01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:06.800
Mark Pock: and it is for itself, but only in itself.

824
01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.229
Mark Pock: It's not for itself, for itself.

825
01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:11.189
Mark Pock: And so

826
01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:15.409
Mark Pock:  with with with humanity, we get

827
01:29:16.170 --> 01:29:18.479
Mark Pock: spirit being for itself.

828
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:26.120
Mark Pock: but not. And this is where Tom comes in, because he's saying, Yeah, we have. We have this proposal.

829
01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:33.810
Mark Pock:  nature to our cognition, and ultimately to our ethical life, which is the most important thing.

830
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:40.830
Mark Pock: right with self-directed, we can get nature, giving the reason, giving the law to nature and supplying the law to itself.

831
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:44.570
Mark Pock: But and so that's the kind of apex of

832
01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:50.739
Mark Pock:  spirit for it

833
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:53.719
Mark Pock: spirit in and for itself.

834
01:29:53.850 --> 01:29:56.380
Mark Pock: which is, we're actually realized that

835
01:29:56.740 --> 01:30:01.400
Mark Pock: we're not opposed to the absolutely that the for itself is actually

836
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:04.269
Mark Pock: the full culmination of nature.

837
01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:12.699
Mark Pock: But what I'm saying is that it's been. You know this is nature, this is the whole, this is everything. All of nature is already spirit.

838
01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:19.570
Mark Pock: and but it's spirit merely in itself.

839
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.870
Mark Pock: and then it's here. It becomes for itself in

840
01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:28.480
Mark Pock: human history. and then it becomes in for itself at the end of history.

841
01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:39.350
Mark Pock: I don't know if that got your question. But what what I was saying universal from the beginning, and it's spirit all the way down from the beginning.

842
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:40.700
Mark Pock: Sure.

843
01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:51.080
Mark Pock: yeah, it just doesn't know itself as such. Sure. Right? Yeah. yes. yeah.

844
01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:10.580
Mark Pock: But they're still. They're still spirits, because they're they're part of nature.

845
01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.479
Mark Pock: Your voice is the

846
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:17.470
Mark Pock: in itself which I will never hear.

847
01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:24.359
Mark Pock: Okay, so it's a basic question. Actually. So when we contrast it itself and for it. So

848
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:41.829
Mark Pock: we're talking mainly about the for itself. As I say, proposing this, yeah. Well, that's the thing is, there's as I think we established. There's a bit of ambiguity. There they'll kind of. He'll kind of shift back and forth between like for itself. As to self-directed versus for itself, is self- objectified

849
01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:49.599
Mark Pock: to be in and for itself.

850
01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:55.270
Mark Pock: in and and for itself. Yes, yeah. And for itself, you would have to be

851
01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:56.840
There you go.

852
01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:01.759
Mark Pock: So just basic basic terms. Yeah, in itself

853
01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:07.679
Mark Pock: is so what? So what does for itself? What is it in itself? Not have that for itself?

854
01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:21.739
Mark Pock: it's it's not self objectified. As yeah, it's probably the different in the main difference. So it doesn't have. It doesn't have difference the way it for itself does work posits difference from install. So it has this.

855
01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:27.239
Mark Pock: So it is for itself. Yeah, the in itself is always for itself, and essentially it is proposal.

856
01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:29.180
Mark Pock: But it

857
01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:39.540
Mark Pock: it's not, it hasn't objectified. It's so, it's yeah. So actually, because what's happening here is, hey? Khan is objective by himself. This is not a

858
01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:42.269
Mark Pock: he's talking about the reason.

859
01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:45.729
Mark Pock: And so he's objectified himself for himself.

860
01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:49.349
Mark Pock: which tells a kind of difference

861
01:32:50.450 --> 01:33:04.780
Mark Pock: that he hasn't actually reconciled and kind of gets expressed in the social. We must be this thing in itself over here.  since forward cell phone in in, in relation to

862
01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:12.930
Mark Pock: so for itself, is is something is for itself in relationship

863
01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:17.890
Mark Pock: to itself or your relationship to a person's consciousness

864
01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:19.650
Mark Pock: that

865
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:32.670
Mark Pock: that oh. that which is for itself is is I. it's a relationship to me. And it's in itself. The relationship to itself

866
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:38.350
Mark Pock: is that it all correct?

867
01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:53.550
Mark Pock:  this is this turns out to be a mean in itself, because reason is self-relating, not the content. No, no, absolutely no call. That's even, for he go ahead for for for

868
01:33:53.890 --> 01:33:58.830
Mark Pock: well, hold on 1 1 1 s because I didn't realize you were talking about Con. Give me 1 s

869
01:33:59.130 --> 01:34:02.939
Mark Pock: because I want to finish. I was, Hey, want to finish with 100

870
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:06.190
Mark Pock:  So

871
01:34:06.530 --> 01:34:20.249
Mark Pock: yeah, I think there's there is often kind of an ambiguity, but like cause, it's a problem, because it is for itself all the way down. Sometimes it's in for it. So it's just not in itself, in for itself. and so

872
01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:26.469
Mark Pock:  but yeah, because there's a sense in which, like

873
01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:31.240
Mark Pock:  mirror, materiality

874
01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:33.040
Mark Pock: kind of isn't self directed.

875
01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:40.610
Mark Pock: even though it kind of is, if but you only kind of find that out later, as he says it's all like retrospective.

876
01:34:41.290 --> 01:34:43.020
Mark Pock: and so like

877
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:48.840
Mark Pock: at the time, it can sort of appear that it doesn't really have any direct self-

878
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:52.899
Mark Pock: in itself for itself and for itself.

879
01:34:52.920 --> 01:35:01.059
Mark Pock: maybe even are more like epistemic markers of the spirits understanding. But I've been on theological flames

880
01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:04.349
Mark Pock: the quality of the thing before. So

881
01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:07.680
Mark Pock: so you.

882
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:17.960
Mark Pock: Yeah.

883
01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:25.360
Mark Pock:  for it. Oh, well.

884
01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:36.050
Mark Pock: I and I think it. Yeah, I mean, if you remember, I I mean, he talks about it. It's been getting right at the what goes on with history.

885
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:39.100
Mark Pock:  in itself is a.

886
01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:42.290
Mark Pock: and so

887
01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.819
Mark Pock: for itself is at.

888
01:35:46.150 --> 01:35:48.920
Mark Pock: But like it's a full thing, because

889
01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:54.509
Mark Pock: is what happens is to that, potency is always

890
01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:02.500
Mark Pock: like you reach a new level, and that becomes potential for something else.

891
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:08.020
Mark Pock: So like the child is potentially. but also

892
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:11.989
it makes our potentially

893
01:36:12.650 --> 01:36:13.550
Mark Pock: child.

894
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:19.330
Mark Pock: and so

895
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:27.950
Mark Pock: yeah, it's it's not. It's it's it's got to go with it kind of feel it out here. But he's getting at

896
01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:36.379
Mark Pock:  because what he, of course, is what he thought, because this is the the thing in itself.

897
01:36:36.710 --> 01:36:38.370
Mark Pock: and what he's saying is that

898
01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:43.950
Mark Pock:  The in itself is not over there.

899
01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.879
Mark Pock: And so it comes for itself

900
01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:58.410
Mark Pock: by this. It's a weird thing, because he's he's saying he's kind of playing a little bit with, for this might have been what you're doing it like for itself. Well, this is how this appears for me

901
01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:06.920
Mark Pock: is that that's what we say. This is the thing for us as opposed to the thing in itself. and what Khan is saying, or hey?

902
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:18.210
Mark Pock: It's kind of an exploiting on ambiguity. There's well, the for itself is also the thing that is for itself, that that initiates its own direction, but also is objectified for itself.

903
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:25.200
Mark Pock:  and so he he's sort of saying that

904
01:37:25.450 --> 01:37:32.790
Mark Pock: this is not a problem. To say that there's a thing weirdly for us, and then there's a thing in itself. if the in itself is for

905
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:39.290
Mark Pock: well, that's nature.

906
01:37:43.170 --> 01:37:48.690
Mark Pock: But in

907
01:37:49.590 --> 01:38:01.459
Mark Pock: yeah. I mean, because there is a lingering. there is a telling you about final causes. Okay.

908
01:38:01.570 --> 01:38:04.170
Mark Pock: that there's a for itself or the falling rock.

909
01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:07.659
Mark Pock: Now Hegel is Post

910
01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:10.180
Mark Pock: Galileo Post, Newton.

911
01:38:11.130 --> 01:38:24.430
Mark Pock: but he's gonna say he has a philosophy of nature that's trying to overcome the mirror mechanism into which Newtonian science fell for singing so. and saying, there is a kind of dynamism

912
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:26.330
Mark Pock: in nature tending towards the

913
01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.900
Mark Pock: which it seemed to have been eliminated by

914
01:38:32.770 --> 01:38:34.389
Mark Pock: falling body is not fall

915
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:36.950
Mark Pock: relative to their to their maths.

916
01:38:37.490 --> 01:38:40.519
Mark Pock: Wait, because that's just air resistance.

917
01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:44.909
Mark Pock: you know, a huge phone ball. And it all the same rate.

918
01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:51.920
Mark Pock: whereas there's always no, they they fall at a different rate, because there's more mass there. And so there's more tendency to go to its

919
01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:53.590
Mark Pock: natural place

920
01:38:54.250 --> 01:38:57.170
Mark Pock: and download the.

921
01:38:57.260 --> 01:39:00.719
Mark Pock: and that seemed to eliminate the whole idea of the

922
01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:08.999
Mark Pock: and cop and a they don't want to say No, there is, there is. This kind of final comes out in nature

923
01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:17.799
Mark Pock: again, it's in principle, not reverting to the pre modern semi-animism of Aristotle.

924
01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:25.810
Mark Pock: I'm having trouble, seeing what is that? It's different. Yeah, okay? Well, actually, you know, I have to study it closely with your nature. We could. I don't know.

925
01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:30.149
Mark Pock: that's actually one of the few things I haven't looked at closely, and I've gone through it.

926
01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:31.529
Mark Pock: But it's been a while.

927
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:36.160
Mark Pock: and because it's it's kind of silly it doesn't need to do that

928
01:39:36.330 --> 01:39:42.189
Mark Pock: longer than this is how to do their thing. You don't need to subway science in this way.

929
01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:48.010
Mark Pock: because what he's going back to is making at the end of this. This is going to happen again like

931
01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:57.430
Mark Pock: That's not how we integrate science.

932
01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:00.869
Mark Pock: He wants to sub like this whole thing.

933
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:05.400
Mark Pock: and we certainly get get proposals back into nature.

934
01:40:08.050 --> 01:40:17.580
Mark Pock: And it's not that you can't actually find it that way. but not stuck away. So that's a whole. But I don't that help

935
01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:25.889
Mark Pock: because it like, because I'm Jc. Saying we're again again. There's there's something that you would. You kind of do have to slide into it.

936
01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:34.549
Mark Pock: And just kind of used to. Okay, now, he's talking about the for itself. And actually, the for itself turns out to be what is in.

937
01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:35.740
Mark Pock: Okay?

938
01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:40.129
Mark Pock:  but once you get the hang of it, it does.

939
01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:46.100
Mark Pock: Lot of it does hold together like it's not just purely arbitrary gibberish.

940
01:40:47.410 --> 01:40:49.220
Mark Pock: Some of it is

941
01:40:49.810 --> 01:40:55.700
Mark Pock: a philosophy nature definitely. but the phenomenology is different, but it's this is where it is.

942
01:40:57.430 --> 01:41:02.790
Mark Pock: You can deal with stuff that you can see. And you can actually test it in your own experience. That's where it becomes interesting.

943
01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:03.940
Mark Pock: Okay?

944
01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:07.110
Mark Pock: All right.

945
01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:10.130
Mark Pock: 2 h. Yes.

946
01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:18.730
Mark Pock: Oh.

947
01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:23.950
