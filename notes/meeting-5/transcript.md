# Meeting Transcript, Meeting 5

## AI Summary
The lecture discusses the concept of consciousness and its relationship with knowledge. It highlights the distinction between being for itself and being in itself, emphasizing the importance of understanding this distinction. Consciousness simultaneously distinguishes itself from something while relating to it. This something exists for consciousness, and the determinant aspect of this relationship is knowing.

The lecture addresses the common mistake of considering something as existing outside the relationship to knowing. It asserts that there is nothing outside the realm of knowing and that the distinction between what is in itself and what is for us arises due to our tendency to forget this fact.

The lecture acknowledges the modern question of certainty and the challenge of knowing if the external world is truly how it appears to us. It suggests that although we encounter this problem, we must go through the process of resolving it rather than relying on predetermined knowledge. It emphasizes the need to recognize that there is no absolute distinction between what is in itself and what is merely for us.

The lecture further discusses the idea of being for itself, explaining that an entity may possess characteristics that are not fully recognized by itself. For example, an infant is rational in itself but not yet fully aware of its rationality. This concept applies to other entities as well, indicating that everything has an inherent self-directedness, but it may not be fully self-objectified.

The lecture introduces the notion of pulling oneself up by the bootstraps, emphasizing that there is no external criterion upon which knowledge can rely. It suggests that matter cannot serve as a firm ground for justifying knowledge. Instead, it asserts that spirit, or consciousness, sustains itself and must find its own footing without relying on an external framework.

In relation to Friedrich Nietzsche, the lecture references the concept of Baron Munchausen pulling himself out of the swamp by his own hair. This analogy highlights the need for spirit or consciousness to rely on itself rather than seeking external validation. It further explores Nietzsche's perspective on bearing ultimate responsibility for one's actions and the rejection of external influences.

Overall, the lecture emphasizes the complex relationship between consciousness, knowledge, and the distinction between being for itself and being in itself. It encourages a deeper understanding of these concepts and the recognition that consciousness sustains itself without relying on external criteria.


Objects are perceived through sensory experience, but Hegel's perspective emphasizes that concepts shape our understanding of objects.
Concepts provide the content and structure to our intuitions, going beyond mere labels or categories.
Sensuous intuition is limited to what can be directly sensed, while concepts like causality extend beyond sensory perception.
Hegel argues that concepts like causality cannot be grounded solely in sensuous intuition, leading to philosophical problems in areas like free will and the existence of God.
Concepts are not static entities but are formed through acts of conceiving.
Concepts and intuitions are interconnected, and without concepts, intuitions remain blind data.
Recognizing the distinction between the act of conceiving and the content of concepts is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of philosophy and knowledge.


In the dialectical movement of experience, the criterion for revealing the changing nature of the object emerges. Negating prior assumptions about the object becomes integral to this process. A moment of skepticism arises, wherein all previous knowledge faces annihilation, leaving us in a state of uncertainty. Yet, it is precisely this apparent loss that paves the way for the emergence of a new object, one that becomes the foundation for deeper knowledge and understanding to unfold.


And that concludes the lecture on sense certainty. As we can see, Hegel delves into the nature of immediate knowledge and explores how it is not as certain as it may seem. He introduces the idea of mediation and highlights the limitations of sense certainty in grasping the essence of objects. Hegel also touches on the concept of the "now" and how it undergoes a dialectical process of negation and transformation. While there may be some confusion or ambiguity in certain parts of the lecture, the overall goal is to challenge our assumptions about knowledge and reality.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.110
Mark Pock: Yeah.

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.430
Mark Pock: long overdue. So yeah.

3
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.940
okay.

4
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.079
Mark Pock:  So what's up?

5
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.849
Mark Pock: What you guys want to talk about?

6
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.049
Mark Pock: How are you all doing?

7
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.619
Mark Pock: Did

8
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.340
Mark Pock: It was

9
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.960
Mark Pock: I had. It's got Asher.

10
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.240
Mark Pock: You can't hold anybody. I guess we'll just

11
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.379
Mark Pock: because there was. Let's see, there was this person. Sarah said she was interested.

12
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.050
Mark Pock: I guess she emailed me

13
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.990
Mark Pock: bye.

14
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:23.870
Mark Pock:  doesn't matter. I I've I've I've completely proud to check this

15
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.380
Mark Pock: And then there was a guy, Asher. I think he signed up on the discord.

16
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.989
Mark Pock: and and then I got in.

17
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.200
Mark Pock: Tyler.

18
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.509
Mark Pock: I can't remember. I thought one of them minded said they were. Gonna try to attend remotely. But I honestly can't remember it.

19
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.550
Mark Pock: Oh, yeah, yeah, I think.

20
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.060
Mark Pock: yeah.

21
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.879
Mark Pock: Yeah. Well, the zoom room is, it's open. Okay?

22
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.340
Mark Pock: Yeah. Yeah.

23
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.159
Mark Pock: Maybe I'll I'll try to make a follow up with them. And kinda I

24
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.689
Mark Pock: I think I sent them those links. Yeah.

25
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.149
Mark Pock: they'll just anything on this one.

26
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.449
Mark Pock: Okay.

27
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.390
Mark Pock:  well.

28
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.829
Mark Pock: there's a few

29
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.190
Mark Pock: different things we can go after today.

30
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:30.849
Mark Pock:  actually didn't have a chance to respond to

31
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.750
Mark Pock: your question, Andre, I?

32
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.919
Mark Pock: Oh, she and I did. I actually downloaded that rawls article. I didn't read it.

33
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:59.800
Mark Pock: Well, what was that really interesting? What was what was it about? It was trying to bridge all this political philosophy with Hegel's metaphysics. And I. So it was. Yeah, generals. It was interesting, because, like.

34
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.609
Mark Pock: I've got a lot of roles in the courses here.

35
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.930
Mark Pock:  And I was having trouble like bridging the 2. But

36
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:15.350
Mark Pock: like, for instance, he was comparing rawls. This concept of like a reflective people in the room with He goes

37
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.419
Mark Pock: like reconciliation. Kind of

38
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.680
Mark Pock: it was iffy, but it was interesting.

39
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.410
Mark Pock: I should have looked at it. Oh, well.

40
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.280
Mark Pock:  well, actually, then, why don't we? Let's just try to look at.

41
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.479
Mark Pock: since there's a question on the board this

42
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.279
Mark Pock: to talk about that, and I got some stuff we can get into. Alright. But let's look at Mark's question here, so

43
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.930
Mark Pock: has to do with or sorry I'm on. This question has to do with

44
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.620
Mark Pock:  paragraph 84

45
00:03:52.070 --> 00:04:05.720
Mark Pock:  and actually, yeah. So like.

46
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:15.230
Mark Pock:  starting at like.  

47
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.940
Mark Pock: So you want to start?

48
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.650
Mark Pock: Yeah, I would say, starting it about paragraph 81.

49
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:37.259
Mark Pock:  we get a kind of, I guess, a, a, a, a new theme, a new theme, and they

50
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.200
Mark Pock: introduction.

51
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.190
Mark Pock: It's

52
00:04:43.900 --> 00:05:01.100
Mark Pock: yeah, it's it's, you know, it's he's bringing up new things. It's in principle. It's related to everything that's going before on going after. But it's a relatively new. okay, so what is it? It's this issue of the criterion, the problem of the criterion for all the criterion of knowledge.

53
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.340
Mark Pock: because

54
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.930
Mark Pock:  on the basis of what

55
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.039
Mark Pock: do we declare? Something to be knowing

56
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.730
Mark Pock: and like,

57
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:30.300
Mark Pock:  yeah, it's a fundamental problem.  

58
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.080
Mark Pock: And because one way to think about this is that

59
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.659
Mark Pock: like, for example, we call, we have this so called scientific method.

60
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.749
Mark Pock: We made it up

61
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.790
Mark Pock: over time. It came into being. It wasn't just sitting there

62
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.170
Mark Pock: and

63
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.520
Mark Pock: but

64
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.840
Mark Pock: what Hegel's getting, what what Hegel is going to get at here is this idea that

65
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:04.110
Mark Pock: the Criterion for? There's a couple of things. One is that it's self-validating because it has to be, because otherwise you're going to

66
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.259
Mark Pock: run into a problem of

67
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:18.570
Mark Pock:  Well, something like Amino's paradox. some kind of notion of comparison. that is, you have the object of knowledge, and then you compare it with

68
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.890
Mark Pock: the criterion. But the criterion itself is just the object.

69
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:33.409
Mark Pock: And you say, Okay, this thing that I know is it, does it correspond to? Can I compare it such that I can see that they are the same thing.

70
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:39.479
Mark Pock: the thing that it is, and the thing that I know. And but of course that begs every question. Because

71
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:46.560
Mark Pock: how do you know in advance of this is the thing you have been looking for? Right? So we've talked about that a few times.

72
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.080
Mark Pock: so there seems like we have. We need a self self validating, but also self correcting

73
00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:01.129
Mark Pock: criterion. Because that's why I asked. The and the last thing is. have you ever known anything at all?

74
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.470
Mark Pock: Okay? And through what did you come to know that? But also.

75
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.950
Mark Pock:  have you ever been wrong?

76
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.070
Mark Pock: Okay? And on the basis of what did you?

77
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.340
Mark Pock: correct yourself?

78
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.709
Mark Pock: Because you could say, well, I saw that it wasn't what I thought it was.

79
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.040
Mark Pock: but that

80
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:33.319
Mark Pock: the very active correcting you can think of again, you can fall into a notion of correction as a kind of comparison, because there was like the thing

81
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.520
Mark Pock: that I

82
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:42.109
Mark Pock: was looking for, and then the thing that turned out to be different than it was, or I had a firm that it had been. But

84
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.400
Mark Pock: You have to assume. You know, the thing that you have now is the thing you were looking for.

85
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.820
and

86
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.069
Mark Pock: on the basis of what you judge that.

87
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.080
Mark Pock: So that's a problem. So you have to. it has to be

88
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:09.640
Mark Pock: arguably has to be still validating self correcting. because that's what we do when we correct for error.

89
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:25.509
Mark Pock: but also a third thing that Hegel is going to talk about is that the actual criterion? This is kind of a big historicist kind of moment in Hegel, which is the criterion itself, changes over time, that is to say, that by which we determine something to be knowledge

90
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.720
Mark Pock: changes.

91
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:45.510
Mark Pock:  So like, for example, yeah, you had the criteria for knowledge. We can. I mean the obvious ones. But they're useful to note, because it was true, for previous sort of sort of so that pretty scientific criteria involved things like

92
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.040
Mark Pock: augury

93
00:08:47.620 --> 00:09:00.350
Mark Pock: like, how did you know something? A magician, ma match, I mean's nowhere. you knew things. If you could sort of manipulate. or seem to manipulate things,

94
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.940
Mark Pock: or describe

95
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:08.270
Mark Pock: the movements of planets or birds, and so on. You, that that was a criterion. What did the birds do?

96
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.110
Mark Pock: Hmm.

97
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:20.529
Mark Pock:  And of course, that that's gone through this process of self correction. There's not. There's there isn't this thing over here that's telling. Oh, yeah, that's the right thing. You guys did it right? You got it right this time

98
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.059
Mark Pock: when we're in rejecting augury or magic. We decided that

99
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:36.340
Mark Pock: presumably we did so intelligently and rationally. But then the question is okay, it seems like intelligence and reason are this criterion. And then what what are those?

100
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:49.899
Mark Pock:  But so, having said that, that was kind of an introduction to get? Because, of course, I'm trying to get back to mark question, what's happening now? Starting at at paragraph roughly 81.

101
00:09:50.050 --> 00:10:01.660
Mark Pock: Because Mark's question has to do with paragraph 84. But I think it's probably useful to just back up ever so slightly. To see this in a little slightly larger context is to look okay. He goes laying out. And there's like

102
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:12.680
Mark Pock: 3 to 5 kind of major moments. Even within this discussion of the criterion, like the the problem with the criterion. Because, like I said, the problem of the criterion is the problem of the Mayo

103
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.950
Mark Pock:  is,

104
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.949
Mark Pock: in some sense, the hermeneutic circle, even

105
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.329
Mark Pock: they're all kind of roughly, the

106
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.979
Mark Pock: going into the same problem which it seems like you already need to know something in the in order to know that, you know.

107
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:37.359
Mark Pock:  And so it seemed like, we have this problem of generating criterion that doesn't doesn't trap us in one of those paradoxes

108
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.259
Mark Pock: or circles. Okay.

109
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:48.880
Mark Pock: so let's look at 81 of us to see like. I said that. So it's the overarching problem. But then there's a kind of a set of sub problems that are like dealing with this overarching problem with the criterion.

110
00:10:50.630 --> 00:11:00.850
Mark Pock: So let's start in 81. In addition to these preliminary general remarks about the manner, necessity of the progression, that is to say, the progression through the various forms of consciousness which hopefully will start today.

111
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:08.169
Mark Pock:  it may be useful to say something about the method of carrying out this inquiry.

112
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:22.130
Mark Pock: That is how he's going to, because he's going. He has a method that in some sense in acts, but also reveals the self correcting self. adjusting process of coming to know.

113
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:36.149
Mark Pock: So he wants to cause he let me actually note one thing. I guess I've got a couple of side notes here that I plan on talking about? I mean this, this, this comes up. So let me just know very, very quickly. We'll try not to get too distracted.

114
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.380
Mark Pock: Oh.

115
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.939
Mark Pock: but we have. Okay, this is an important, it's, it's it's a whole thing. People talk about

116
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.259
Mark Pock: all the thing. But so we have, you know, as we're going to see.

117
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:54.910
Mark Pock: you know, these forms of consciousness. and we haven't said enough about them yet, like they are you

118
00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:07.589
Mark Pock: and they there's different. There's this, there's a progression of forms, and we need to establish what they are, how they relate to another, how they transition from one to the next. That's on the way.

119
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:14.390
Mark Pock: But there's another thing that's happening all along, which is that we have this thing called the phenomenological observer.

120
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.469
Mark Pock: This is actually partly what has that state in your question. Andre.

121
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.970
Mark Pock: yeah. which is that we're observing this?

122
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:33.129
Mark Pock: We're so. And this is why I said, we don't need to do anything but step back and watch consciousness do this on its own. But we that

123
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.829
Mark Pock: but it but that's that gets back to you. Hi, there's point, because the phenomenological observer.

124
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.029
Mark Pock: Okay, these forms of consciousness think one thing is happening

125
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:49.549
Mark Pock: as I am as they develop. That is half the time they don't know that they're developing.

126
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.439
Mark Pock: So they don't know that about themselves.

127
00:12:52.930 --> 00:13:09.600
Mark Pock: amongst many other things. So they think one thing is happening. We know something else has happened. We, the phenomenological observer. Now, of course. it seems like we need to have already read the cause. This is the whole permanent circle. You need to have read the whole play in order to understand the beginning of the play.

128
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.590
Mark Pock: So in some sense we need to already have read the phenomenology to read the phenomenology.

129
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.079
Mark Pock: which, of course, is in principle true for any work.

130
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:30.260
Mark Pock: but Hegel is sort of embedding this principle into the work itself, kind of calling our attention to it, that all along with what these forms of consciousness think they're doing and think what's happening is not actually what's happening.

131
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:36.600
Mark Pock: And we both will produce, then is, watch how they correct themselves.

132
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.140
Mark Pock: they continually get it wrong.

133
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.899
Mark Pock: but they add each time they get it wrong to add something new.

134
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.600
Mark Pock: Something doesn't merge

135
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.719
Mark Pock: which is to say, one of the things that emerges the new criterion.

136
00:13:50.850 --> 00:14:05.080
Mark Pock: So as we see in the sense that the initial criterion for knowing is the media. immediate sense intuition. Oh, some subside note on the word intuition I mentioned this last time clarify.

137
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:09.610
Mark Pock: is it on showing that that doesn't really matter?

138
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.730
Mark Pock: So that's just the German. But

139
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:20.210
Mark Pock: this does not mean when you, when it's in a a content or a yelling

140
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:25.880
Mark Pock: necessarily in context, does not refer to you like

141
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.630
Mark Pock: I had an intuition you might show up, and then you showed up

142
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:36.339
Mark Pock: it as it refers. It's a technical term that refers to for the most part

143
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.410
Mark Pock: sense data.

144
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.450
Mark Pock: immediate sense data.

145
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.899
Mark Pock: because

146
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.700
Mark Pock: they're partly the remote context. For this is actually.

147
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:53.620
Mark Pock: I think I mentioned that which is. you have concept

148
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:59.399
Mark Pock: the concepts, the form. So concepts in the situation, of course, form and matter. Okay?

149
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.360
Mark Pock: And so you have

150
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:09.369
Mark Pock: and this is What? What? What cons? Of course, it's big challenge to him

151
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:18.700
Mark Pock: is that Hume says, okay, we generate the notion of calls all through repeated experience, right through awesome. The experience of constant conjunction of similar events.

152
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:24.909
Mark Pock: that over time we associate one with the other, and one of the forms of those association is cause an effect? Okay?

153
00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.920
Mark Pock: And so the form. the concept, causality.

154
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:37.140
Mark Pock: is generated from sense experience, from from the intuition of various sensible objects. And what Kant says, is no.

155
00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:43.309
Mark Pock: because in order to have sensuous experience at all, to even see one

156
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:50.060
Mark Pock: fill your ball, collide with another bill, your ball. your your this already has to be formed

157
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.720
Mark Pock: by the forms of consciousness, by the

158
00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:08.569
Mark Pock: okay. So that's why these are the conditions of the possibility of experience. But the point is that there? But there is a distinction that that cop would have us note. which is that there is a decision between

159
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.810
Mark Pock: intuition, which

160
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.230
Mark Pock: this is a whole thing. It's pre conceptual, pre discursive. This is where you get

161
00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.140
Mark Pock: who Serrell?

162
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:35.260
Mark Pock: doing things here? And then the question is, can you have like? Well, how do you? And then know that you have this because you have to speak about it? And it seems like we're using discourse in order to speak about the prescript. Blah blah blah kind of questions. Come up

163
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:49.420
Mark Pock: so I guess we can let me let me prevent myself from going too far. A field. The main point I wanted to get out here was that intuition when when it's using this context, does not mean like flash of insights or something. I have an intuition that means

164
00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:54.580
Mark Pock: more or less immediate, sensuous material or data. But

165
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.960
Mark Pock: sometimes it can mean, like you can talk about like.

166
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.380
Mark Pock: for example, cop will talk about an intuitive intellect.

167
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:15.110
Mark Pock: an intuitive intellect which doesn't understand things conceptually, or sometimes it discursively, but as a sort of direct intuition of some kind of intelligibility. I know I know, Aima.

168
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:20.449
Mark Pock: so no, so see the would be a kind of

169
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.609
Mark Pock: or

170
00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.029
Mark Pock: the Neumann.

171
00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:33.659
Mark Pock: So this is what God would be. God would be a kind of immediate intuition of the whole reality.

172
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:39.799
Mark Pock: God doesn't have to reason out what things, how things and why things happen if we if there were such a

173
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:53.670
Mark Pock:  as opposed to us rational meetings, finite, rational things, we have to kind of reason discursively, using concepts to understand. So I don't want to confuse us. I'm just saying that intuition typically, is this kind of sensuous media. See?

174
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.970
Mark Pock: But there's another sense in which it's just any kind of a mean

175
00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.140
Mark Pock:  which would be corresponded to some kind of

176
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.790
Mark Pock: understanding of it.

177
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.200
Mark Pock: Okay?

178
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:14.240
Mark Pock: yeah. So that that was that I wanted to clarify. Because.

179
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.000
Mark Pock: yeah, what I like, I said, for the first form of consciousness that we're going to encounter in certainty.

180
00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:20.799
Mark Pock: It takes what

181
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:31.959
Mark Pock: Hegel uses various terms something he just calls it, since consciousness. but he will kinda say, like immediacy or intuition, because he's alluding to this content background

182
00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.540
Mark Pock: and then, of course.

183
00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:54.630
Mark Pock: one of the things he was going to point out is that this criterion of immediacy. is it it? It it gets. That's the thing. It can't satisfy itself on its own grounds. That's why we, as phenomenal observers, we don't import some criterion that we know secretly, if end is the real criterion.

184
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.740
Mark Pock: We do know that which is why we can understand what's happened.

185
00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:09.089
Mark Pock: but we don't import it into these various forms of conscious. We let them play out their own criteria and let them defeat themselves on their own grounds.

186
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.400
Mark Pock: Yes.

187
00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:22.110
Mark Pock: yes, the form of consciousness experiences the problem. It runs into a a contradiction that can't surmount without changing.

188
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:27.360
Mark Pock: But it doesn't understand that. It's what the nature of the problem is it? It just experiences it.

189
00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:36.929
Mark Pock: It's it's a natural

190
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:45.030
Mark Pock: right? Right? Oh. you go, hey, go!

191
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.529
Mark Pock: We'll say, No, no, no, yeah.

192
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:58.839
Mark Pock: This or this isn't what's actually happening.  yeah. So that's that was

193
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:09.110
Mark Pock: I just realized. I wanted to make sure I mentioned the the both phenomenological observer and this notion of intuition to get it clear on, because

194
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:16.649
Mark Pock: I think I use them. or I forgot. I failed to mention it for a while ago. Server not used intuition last time, and I I didn't clarify what I meant

195
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.819
Mark Pock: But I mean

196
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.559
Mark Pock: in some sense, yeah.

197
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:30.649
Mark Pock:  I mean, Kant is a big part of this, for I mean as much as Hegel

198
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:40.699
Mark Pock: Pickle doesn't like Con at all. Okay, highly critical. And he just it's kind of disparaging at times. I I I disagree with with Pip and Nuts, who says that

199
00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:45.299
Mark Pock: to the major influence on Hegel, and like he's a fundamental influence, I think

200
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.069
Mark Pock: that's misunderstood. I think

201
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:58.170
Mark Pock: Aristotle is. You can look at the lectures on history of philosophy. The the on Aristotle is like 3 times as long as anyone else. So if you really want to get it But

202
00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.029
Mark Pock: despite what Hegel might have said about himself.

203
00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:12.459
Mark Pock: You. It is useful to know a lot of cons to get into what Hegel's doing, because it because it's the immediate context, not just con, it's really con to. And then Shelling, who was his friend and roommate, and they

204
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.749
Mark Pock: But anyway, so we don't. Obviously we're not going to study them. But

205
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.390
Mark Pock: I'll try to give you

206
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.539
Mark Pock: some links to Kant as they come up, because we kind of need them.

207
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.550
Mark Pock: But we can. Yeah, anyway.

208
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.950
Mark Pock: Okay? So

209
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:45.040
Mark Pock:  if this exposition is viewed as a way of relating science to phenomenal knowledge, that is the forms of consciousness as they emerge. Right? So that's the another thing about phenomenal knowledge is to say.

210
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:55.259
Mark Pock: consciousness that it emerges as we just observe it as it appears to us. and what it's doing without us importing our own standard as to what it should be.

211
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:08.260
Mark Pock: and as an investigation and examination of the reality of cognition, it would seem to me that it cannot take place without some presupposition which can serve as an underlying criterion

212
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:17.520
Mark Pock: for an examination consistent, apply and accepted standard. and then determining whether something is right or wrong on the basis of the resulting agreement or disagreement with that thing examined.

213
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.939
Mark Pock:  of the thing examined. Thus, the standard, as such.

214
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:36.610
Mark Pock: is accepted as the essence or as in itself. But here, where science has just come on the scene, neither science nor anything else. So because we do have to eventually. This is the thing. It's the it's the circle. Because, like

215
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.260
Mark Pock: Hegel saying, this is what we're going to do.

216
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:49.520
Mark Pock: But why should this be the the method. In some sense we sort of already need to be at the end. to to have this, to have justified this very approach.

217
00:22:50.450 --> 00:23:00.610
Mark Pock:  where science is just become on the scene. Neither science or anything else has justified itself as the essence of the in a cell phone without making it something of it

218
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.159
Mark Pock: of the sort. It seems that no examination can take place. Okay.

219
00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:14.800
Mark Pock: this contradiction and its removal will become more definite if we call to mind the abstract determinations of truth and knowledge as they occur in consciousness.

220
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:22.800
Mark Pock: Okay, so truth is the object. Knowledge is the subject. But as we're going to see these it continually kind of reverted and inverted as they

221
00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.260
Mark Pock: as things go forward.

222
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:30.110
Mark Pock: So we at 1 point thought, was the object turns out to be the subject.

223
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.300
Mark Pock: So for kont.

224
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:36.049
Mark Pock: what we thought was

225
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.730
Mark Pock: causality was over here. and the object.

226
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.379
Mark Pock: even pretty hum especially turns out it's it's here.

227
00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.889
Mark Pock: Okay. So which is to say, in the concept, or the the notion or or knowledge

228
00:23:53.640 --> 00:24:04.070
Mark Pock:  consciousness. Okay, then, then, this gets into this whole thing. Here consciousness simultaneously distinguishes itself from something at the same time relates itself to it.

229
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.909
Mark Pock: or, as it is said that this something exists for consciousness.

230
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:14.089
Mark Pock: and this the determinant aspect of this relating, or of the being of something, for consciousness is knowing.

231
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.380
Mark Pock: So the being of something for consciousness is knowing.

232
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:29.470
Mark Pock: But we distinguish the being for another from being in itself. Whatever is related to knowledge or knowing is distinguished from it, and positive as existing outside of the relationship. Now, here's the thing.

233
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.090
Mark Pock: A lot of people get stuck here.

234
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.950
Mark Pock: He's saying, we do this.

235
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:41.169
Mark Pock: but we're it's not right, we're we. We do this. We do positive distinction.

236
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:46.209
Mark Pock: as if there was just the being in itself outside the relation to knowing.

237
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.889
Mark Pock: I see. But that's not correct.

238
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.109
Mark Pock: There's nothing ever outside the relation to knowing

239
00:24:54.610 --> 00:25:12.629
Mark Pock: We we do that. And then we forget that we've done that. And then we have all these problems that arise which was earlier in the the whole thing about the problem of the bridge. How can I be certain? That's the whole modern question not going to be certain that the thing out there is like what it is for me.

240
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:20.179
Mark Pock: but the fact that that as kind of partially getting to your question, we have to do that, though

241
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.560
Mark Pock: we have to go through that that error

242
00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:37.719
Mark Pock: and in and trying to solve it, but not by just knowing in advance. Oh, yeah, really, don't worry. It's actually the self differentiating spirit. We have to deal with the fact that it seems like there is a distinction between what is in itself and what is merely for us.

243
00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:46.950
Mark Pock: This is a quick question. Yeah. So I understand that I think so then. But then why do we need to go from being for itself to being in an important so

244
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:51.670
Mark Pock: well, that would just be, I suppose, the

245
00:25:52.550 --> 00:26:02.469
Mark Pock: It's been kind of happy, so I don't know why, actually, why are we inscribed to it so well, because then we would just be contents.

246
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:13.890
Mark Pock: because we say, Well, we only ever know what is for us, what it merely appears to us. And what Hegel says earlier is that? Well, then, we're in this problem, saying, Well, there's 2 types of knowledge

247
00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:26.750
Mark Pock: and 2 types of true. There is the phenomenal the phenomenon of the appearances, and that's remember. Don't don't forget the phenomena. The wrong with the phenomenon in cont is the totality of

248
00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:35.790
Mark Pock: science. It's the whole Antonian universe and con saying, but yeah, but that's just how things appear. That's not really reality in itself.

249
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:41.110
Mark Pock: Yeah, science is great. And we know all this stuff. but it's not knowledge of the really real.

250
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.530
Mark Pock: the really real.

251
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:52.020
Mark Pock: the thing in itself. Hmm! And so Hegel's Hegel is just saying, like

252
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:58.829
Mark Pock: one thing, consciousness doesn't settle for that. We demand the thing in itself.

253
00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:05.520
Mark Pock: and 2, it was never actually separated from us. In the first place. We just have to recollect that.

254
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:14.339
Mark Pock: Not as if not as of yeah, of course. But though he will, he will say that

255
00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.120
Mark Pock: not that he's going to provide a proof.

256
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:23.980
Mark Pock: but that you're going to see you're going to participate in the proof itself.

257
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:35.530
Mark Pock: Sure. Sure. Okay, so in here, this is this is Michael inwards?  dictionary.

259
00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.960
Mark Pock: and

260
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.070
Mark Pock: and what he does in here

261
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:13.150
Mark Pock: is, among other things, I really find this What he does is he, miss?

262
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:21.889
Mark Pock: what the be in itself meetings. And then you give 4 different explanations of what the

263
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:31.390
Mark Pock: and they give a 4 different definition of what they're being in for itself. It's

264
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.150
Mark Pock: or do you want to read them? Or

265
00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.910
Mark Pock: as for me.

266
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.640
Mark Pock: so

267
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.809
Mark Pock: one of the things that you see is that it's not first off. It's not just one

268
00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.150
Mark Pock: kind of uses them in different ways.

269
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.510
Mark Pock: And so so get

270
00:28:53.280 --> 00:29:01.219
Mark Pock: It's it's it's difficult to keep up with people sometimes, because sometimes it means it's one way to

271
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.970
yeah. Yeah, very true. That's true, absolutely.

272
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.539
Mark Pock: Yeah. That happens a lot

273
00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:13.709
Mark Pock:  I found it being for it. So because you were bringing that up.

274
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.509
Mark Pock: that which is not.

275
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:26.150
Mark Pock: But

276
00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:32.999
Mark Pock: yeah, see what it is about for itself.

277
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.320
Mark Pock: Yeah. Okay.

278
00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.459
Mark Pock: so each of these ideas.

279
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:53.410
Mark Pock:  you know how much that was

280
00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.400
Mark Pock: being for another.

281
00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.370
Mark Pock: if you need

282
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:06.710
Mark Pock: things like that.

283
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:20.390
Mark Pock:  yeah. Okay. So the idea

284
00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.979
Mark Pock: is is a

285
00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.890
Mark Pock: Oh, we're all.

286
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.740
Mark Pock: Yeah.

287
00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.470
Mark Pock: Okay. Thank you.

288
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:47.759
Mark Pock:  yeah. So we've covered the most of this. So

289
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.720
Mark Pock: the idea

290
00:30:49.740 --> 00:31:01.289
Mark Pock: that if something is so, this is a second, the first one. I'm not really sure what is getting at but second one. So the idea that if something is for itself, it is aware of itself.

291
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:11.750
Mark Pock: leads to the further idea that an entity may have in itself certain characteristics that are not for itself. So an infinite infant is rational in itself, but not for itself.

292
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:25.450
Mark Pock:  so yeah, I think we we covered that, although in some sense it is for itself, just not for itself. That's that's the problem. Because all

293
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:30.169
Mark Pock: the the the organism as an infant has already begun to direct itself.

294
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:38.840
Mark Pock: so just the seed is already for itself just not for itself.

295
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:43.470
Mark Pock:  it's only

296
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:48.059
Mark Pock: So it doesn't recognize itself yet. As for itself.

297
00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:51.030
Mark Pock: right?

298
00:31:51.420 --> 00:32:01.089
Mark Pock: And so that's why it's it's there. What I'm saying is, there's ambiguities already here. There's a there are ambiguity. So yes, it's true that in some sense an infant is rational merely in itself, but not for itself.

299
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:03.470
Mark Pock: because

300
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:09.400
Mark Pock: that's I mean, like, I said, the one of the basic distinctions is

301
00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.940
Mark Pock: the basic distinction in self-directed

302
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.730
Mark Pock: versus So I

303
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:29.479
Mark Pock: in terms of and making it in the very notion of for itself. So in some sense everything is

304
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:32.989
Mark Pock: is self directed all the way down to

305
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:40.980
Mark Pock: nearest nature. and he as he says, he's trying to recover the Aristotleian cosmology really.

306
00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:44.710
Mark Pock: where there, where there is directionality to even motion.

307
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:53.450
Mark Pock: But certainly by the time, like I said in the first meeting, really, it's organisms. Okay, he's an organicist. And so

308
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.899
Mark Pock: once you're on the level of life. You have self-direction.

309
00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:00.309
Mark Pock: which is to some extent for itself, but life as life

310
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.810
Mark Pock: it's for itself, but never for itself.

311
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:09.190
Mark Pock: that is to say, because it never objectifies itself.

312
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:16.000
Mark Pock: because that's I'm referring to a self objectified, then.

313
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:22.319
Mark Pock: that is to say, you have it so. The so, for example, the rational man

314
00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.920
Mark Pock: isn't necessarily fully

315
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.800
Mark Pock: for themselves, either, in the sense because they haven't done philosophy yet.

316
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.609
Mark Pock: Well, he said, he.

317
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.849
Mark Pock: That

318
00:33:42.070 --> 00:34:04.010
Mark Pock: may not be actual

319
00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:08.469
Mark Pock:  3 is

320
00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.610
Mark Pock: yeah.

321
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:15.969
Mark Pock: Well, no. The tree was always for itself. That's the thing. Is that

322
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.989
Mark Pock:  the tree develops

323
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.290
Mark Pock: from the.

324
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.550
Mark Pock: and then it's and the fruit.

325
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.729
Mark Pock: But the problem is that

326
00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:35.870
Mark Pock: now they're outside one another. Okay, now, there's a distinction  and the

327
00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.309
Mark Pock: plant precisely does not recognize itself in the fruit

328
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:48.570
Mark Pock: because it's not conscious, some intelligent. it has objectified itself. but not for itself. Well.

329
00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:55.750
Mark Pock: since since, as as opposed to

330
00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:07.380
Mark Pock: yeah, it's women from potency to act. Yeah, so it is. It is self directed.

331
00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.849
Mark Pock: but it's not self- objectified.

332
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:21.540
Mark Pock: It is implicitly in itself. That's the thing in itself. It's sort of. It's all projected by this. As we we've got, there's a whole analogy. He deals with this in the intro. We did this, I think, the first day.

333
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:34.720
Mark Pock: So there's a whole analogy in the introduction to what shows on this. Your philosophy relays this out and differentiates this this from consciousness, which pauses. It's an object, but the object doesn't fall outside. It's relation.

334
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:41.510
Mark Pock: that is, it remains internal to consciousness. But even then it may not be an adequate.

335
00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.650
Mark Pock: that is to say, you can objectify yourself in ways that are not adequate.

336
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.070
Mark Pock: And so like, you're not actually for yourself fully yet.

337
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.419
Mark Pock: And that goes through a series of developments itself.

338
00:35:54.430 --> 00:36:10.909
Mark Pock: That's why it so it's there's not just the in itself for itself. There's in itself at this stage, and then they itself at the next stage, and then it's up, and the for itself, this stage for self, for the next stage, as it things go. And then there is in some sense a of Ted. They're sort of like provisional in and for themselves.

339
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:19.080
Mark Pock: but they turned out they're sort of they kind of, because everything in some sense is in for self, because everything is, and everything is for itself

340
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:29.320
Mark Pock:  But it's not self objectified adequately. That's the whole thing. The big thing with the object has to be adequate to the concept

341
00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.630
Mark Pock: right until you get full and and for itself.

342
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:43.140
Mark Pock: because being in some sense has to come into being to be adequate to its own concept.

343
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:52.740
Mark Pock: Hmm! But there, there is only ever be. There's no some that's the thing you can't think of. The concept is outside dictating some external criterion.

344
00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:58.769
Mark Pock: It's not like it's catching up to something

345
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.970
Mark Pock: I don't know does that? I don't know if that helps.

346
00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.940
Mark Pock: But yeah. So there, this is just to say, there's

347
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:15.249
Mark Pock: there's there's yeah, there's other ways. You can kind of cash out the ambiguity. But I would. I would just say that

348
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:24.229
Mark Pock: these are, if you can get a hold of this, that he and he will kind of shift back and forth. He won't always clarify when he's making using these in different senses.

349
00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:30.949
Mark Pock:  and like, yeah, sometimes it's obviously an act, and so on.

350
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:40.520
Mark Pock:  yeah, yeah, it's like, I, I I don't understand like the

351
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:50.930
Mark Pock: we haven't even finished that. So right. But keep going. What it's like. How much of that is kind of like Nisha is pulling yourself up this wall, going on here.

352
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.550
Mark Pock: Well, that's barren munches.

353
00:37:53.450 --> 00:38:01.319
Mark Pock: You guys know that you guys are Terry Gilliam and

354
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:09.100
Mark Pock: it's called, what's this cause? It was it was much I was in that fell into the quicksand and pull himself up. By the but you said, Nietzsche says this.

355
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:14.600
Mark Pock: oh, I need your reference to yeah. Yeah. So that because it is, I think it's a German thing, so it makes sense.

356
00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:20.519
Mark Pock: But the Baron Munchausen and I I don't know if it's this. I don't think it's the same origin as Munchausen. But

357
00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.040
Mark Pock: Munchausen's disease.

358
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:41.510
Mark Pock: You guys know what it is for someone to be sick to get attention more. It's kind of pathology. But then there's also munch houses for a proxy. Where parents do that to their children they constantly bring them to the er sometimes they may actually give them things that make them sick.

359
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.869
Mark Pock: I think. Hem! And he said his mom would do that to him.

360
00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.459
Mark Pock: Yeah, but it's M. And M.

361
00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:52.980
Mark Pock: That old guy from a long time ago.

362
00:38:53.850 --> 00:39:01.300
Mark Pock:  but yeah, there's so yeah, so you pull on your cell phone. But yeah, spirit pulls itself up by the bootstraps.

363
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:13.650
Mark Pock: because there is no outside, because in the very ideas like well, then, there would be some kind of thing you have to stand on.

364
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:23.690
Mark Pock: That's external. That's it, supplying a kind of criterion that you can trust in advance. This is this is firm and steady ground. This is being in itself.

365
00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:29.349
Mark Pock: and I'm going to kind of pull myself to be on that safe ground now, as if I knew in advance. That's what it was

366
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.130
Mark Pock: when I could just be more quick quicksand.

367
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:47.899
Mark Pock: So you have to find you can't rely. That's actually kind of a useful image because of Kegel is going to say, yeah, matter can never be. The criterion. Matter cannot be the firm ground upon which we stand

368
00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.830
Mark Pock: to justify knowledge, whereas for some it is.

369
00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:56.680
Mark Pock: and I'm just exploiting the analogy there a little bit. But

370
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.480
Mark Pock: spirit, only spirit. We can sustain itself.

371
00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:07.319
Mark Pock:  yeah, matter will fall. There's not anything beneath it.

372
00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.510
Mark Pock: Hmm.

373
00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:25.140
Mark Pock: yeah, okay. But what's yeah, very good, very good. But so what is he? What does he just say, what? What's his? What is he saying? There, I don't think it's like a a criticism of

374
00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.420
Mark Pock: of it's it's a it's a metaphysical.

375
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:42.569
Mark Pock: What a lot of philosophy does is pull the cell phone by its own here cause. I, because I think me too, is okay with that right? I mean the will to power itself. The whole thing right? I'm not sure I I feel so critical about it. But

376
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:51.480
Mark Pock:  what? I forget how to spell Munchausen.

377
00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:06.100
Mark Pock: the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and to absolve God. The world ancestors. Chance of society involves nothing less than to be precisely this

378
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:15.589
Mark Pock: calls a suite, and to pull himself up into existence by the hair out of the swamp, it into nothing

379
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:22.810
Mark Pock: from the from the swamp.

380
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:30.599
Mark Pock: What is it? A speech in 1,966? But So it's a reference to something.

381
00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:41.020
Mark Pock: It would be yeah, beyond good and evil.

382
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:45.940
Mark Pock: Yeah. Paragraph 21

383
00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:50.690
Mark Pock: for section 21. Oh, you're a good neighbor. Yes.

384
00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.619
Mark Pock: I lost it. Keep it.

385
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:55.570
Mark Pock: Yeah.

386
00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.030
Mark Pock: yeah.

387
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:26.269
Mark Pock: So let's see, we can put it on the we're at. Okay. So that's I was like, okay, am I on camera like right here.

388
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:36.970
Mark Pock: So life. Okay. So if I go or sorry you, your life is fundamentally will to power the doctor that every power draws the ultimate consequence that every month. Okay.

389
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.569
Mark Pock: The extreme form of this of this doctrine.

390
00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:52.989
Mark Pock: however, is the brief that will is totally okay. So that's the issue that a hundred times with you in theory of free will which needs that need to. So he's saying, you don't have free will.

391
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:57.200
Mark Pock: even though life is fundamentally will the power

392
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:04.029
Mark Pock: Extravagant pride has led man to believe that he is an autonomous creature that is, as well as entirely free

393
00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:10.570
Mark Pock: here he's talking more about this is, this is probably yeah.

394
00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:15.439
Mark Pock: it's actually kind of interesting, because he he's sort of he's referring. If you were to be

395
00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:24.680
Mark Pock: to kind of be sympathetic to what he's talking about here. or because con for coffee will is a.

396
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:38.199
Mark Pock: It's a it's a new and all thing. It's an uncaused cause. We don't experience it as such. We have to pause it as such in order to claim for ourselves ultimate responsibility. The will cannot be conditioned by anything else.

397
00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:46.020
Mark Pock: and for for Hegel it's a bit opposite. If you remember, you go from natural inclination to content discipline to

398
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.550
Mark Pock: a kind of sublation of your inclinations.

399
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.870
Mark Pock: And you. This is the thing. You sort of

400
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:57.090
Mark Pock: realize that spirit posited its own conditions.

401
00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:00.140
Mark Pock: But it's not. It's not

402
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.040
Mark Pock: mere license, it's not near

403
00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:10.249
Mark Pock: free will, and the kind of vulgar, either libertarian sense, or even in the content sense of just

404
00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:14.660
Mark Pock: spontaneous will. It's educated

405
00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.029
Mark Pock: cultivated

406
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:22.680
Mark Pock: desire, which is kind of what the will to power really is for Nietzsche, too.

407
00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.120
Mark Pock: like to

408
00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:35.040
Mark Pock: to. It's not just caprice. So they're actually in German. It's versus they look as caprice versus vila, which is

409
00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:46.239
Mark Pock: different. It's not America. Priest. Okay? So this view of the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself. That's con.

410
00:44:47.300 --> 00:45:00.099
Mark Pock: and to absolve the God the world ancestors chance in society, which Hegel would all take into account. That's conditioning it will. And while it's nothing less than the precisely

411
00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:07.529
Mark Pock: that. How the Sui. and to pull himself into existence by the hair out of the swamp of nothingness.

412
00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.070
Mark Pock: Now, of course, in some sense. Yeah.

413
00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:15.669
Mark Pock: that is, that is what it was. But what he's talking about more precisely. Here is

414
00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:22.720
Mark Pock: what I'm trying to say is that and what I was thinking. Well, Nietzsche. for me to yeah, the the will to power is

415
00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:27.970
Mark Pock: all of reality, and in some sense is self-conditioning. But he's trying to say that it's different than

416
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:32.690
Mark Pock: this abstract content will that is just

417
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:38.230
Mark Pock: beyond experience, like hiding my power

418
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:47.920
Mark Pock: cause. That's what cause cause. What for the the point is that if the will is conditioned by something external to itself, it's not free.

419
00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.669
Mark Pock: And so we can't hold people responsible.

420
00:45:52.220 --> 00:46:07.279
Mark Pock: That's what we say we say, well, it was a like, it was some psychological malady, it was. Society put me in this condition, and so the whole point of like holding moral responsibility is just gone unless you have a non-cost cause.

421
00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:16.770
Mark Pock: Hmm! Now, the problem is that because causality is the condition of the possibility of experience. We never experience ourselves as on caused causes.

422
00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.260
Mark Pock: but we have to postulate ourselves as such as nominal

423
00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:29.079
Mark Pock: nominally goes, that we can hold responsible, even though we can never be really sure that it was with us.

424
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.389
Mark Pock: It's kind of yeah. It runs into a problem like, How do you hold someone responsible and say, this is your fault

425
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:41.240
Mark Pock: as well. We have to postulate that they ultimately

426
00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:46.689
Mark Pock: acted merely from themselves, even though they and us never actually experience something like that.

427
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:51.470
Mark Pock: anyway.

428
00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:57.850
Mark Pock: So but back to your actual question it was. The point is that

429
00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:03.830
Mark Pock: yeah, in one sense, it's true. but I don't know if he is critiquing

430
00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:12.699
Mark Pock: Hegel at that point, because there is some sense in which niece is talking about himself, too. He's just trying to say this is a naive view of the will, which is just kind of spontaneous

431
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:16.500
Mark Pock:  caprice.

432
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:28.279
Mark Pock: Well, that's a that's a point of contention as to what, how you know the the who's hang on which Nietzsche are we talking about?

433
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:40.370
Mark Pock: Oh, Nietzsche's Nietzsche? Okay.

434
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:48.430
Mark Pock: that's a long story. I mean the whole

435
00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.509
Mark Pock: master slave dialectic is

436
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.339
Mark Pock: you could say. The entirety of

437
00:47:56.630 --> 00:48:06.570
Mark Pock: Nietzsche's master of morality or slave round is already there, and the problem is that Nietzsche doesn't go far enough with Ego. But he's fully, you know.

438
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:10.799
Mark Pock: a Galen up to a point. So there's all different ways to approach that

440
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.939
Mark Pock: this is

442
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:49.200
Mark Pock: So

443
00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:58.380
Mark Pock: of the concept of reflection which it rises to the confusion.

444
00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.890
Mark Pock: And so he has here.

445
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:09.199
Mark Pock: Yeah, I actually

446
00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:27.879
Mark Pock: not a close student that so cot starts to bring in some some wild terminal like even beyond Hegel is uses and and fibolis parallelism, analogies of what's even for even for Hegel. It's wild. This is this is the later parts of the

447
00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:37.359
Mark Pock: But it's different than a paradox. It's different than a parallelism. It's different than a

448
00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:44.009
Mark Pock: Yeah, I'm not I. It's fine. But I, you just said you you just use and and fibly, and I wasn't sure if they

449
00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:52.350
Mark Pock: okay here since

450
00:49:54.650 --> 00:50:00.350
Mark Pock:  he says he's talking about the notion of.

451
00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:06.690
Mark Pock: And he said, if we want to call this object

452
00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:13.510
Mark Pock: because the presentation of it is not sensible. and we if we do so. so we.

453
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:17.740
Mark Pock: you know.

454
00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:21.310
we can say that there's something behind that.

455
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.470
Mark Pock: It's

456
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:27.710
Mark Pock: But

457
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:40.120
Mark Pock: since we cannot apply to any of our concepts of understanding, the presentation yet remains empty for us, and does not serve for anything but to block the bounds of our sensible cognition.

458
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:59.660
Mark Pock: he said, we can be virtually that, but it's an empty notion, because it's not that there is some archaeological

459
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:05.560
Mark Pock: well, there could be

460
00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:17.400
Mark Pock: there could be. We don't know that. So it's not that. It's not that there is one. He's saying that we do not know whether there is

461
00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:21.429
Mark Pock: he. He says that the concept of the minimum

462
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:30.290
Mark Pock: is So it's a boundary. Well, our sensible cognition. So it's really, in my view.

463
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.899
Mark Pock:  and it's some a logical boundary.

464
00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:39.939
Mark Pock: because we don't know whether, even if it exist or not. And the only thing we know that

465
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:49.010
Mark Pock: we can not them eligible to be involved with understanding our things that confirmed to the characters, and

466
00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:53.730
Mark Pock: 3 of the 3 of the categories are

467
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:57.309
Mark Pock: distance, necessity, and possibility

468
00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:03.950
Mark Pock: impossible, and we can't even say that it exists.

469
00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:07.969
Mark Pock: We just don't know. and we should be building it as possible.

470
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:31.669
Mark Pock: I

471
00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:34.129
not just

472
00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:43.419
Mark Pock: the use of understanding.

473
00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:47.059
Mark Pock: and thus objects that it is possible into machines.

474
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:55.439
Mark Pock: It's going to go into concepts instead of concepts conforming to possible the traditions is that we are

475
00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:00.349
Mark Pock: so today. That's

476
00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:04.220
Mark Pock: she will come. Not that it's not

477
00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:13.909
Mark Pock: it's true, but it's not that the matter out there. There are ideas that you can forward to the matter

478
00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:17.610
Mark Pock: when he's out there. It's

479
00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:25.040
Mark Pock: no

480
00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:27.070
Mark Pock: it's

481
00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:35.020
Mark Pock:  yeah. Actually, could you come back to that.

482
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:36.920
Mark Pock: That's the thing.

483
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:38.330
Mark Pock: Just one thing.

484
00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:42.820
Mark Pock: What's the which we're going to be getting to?

485
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:46.800
Mark Pock:  if you want to?

486
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:52.480
Mark Pock: What do you think? what or or are you reading? Oh, I do

487
00:53:58.380 --> 00:53:59.290
Mark Pock: right.

488
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:08.929
Mark Pock: So right. So one of the one of the things to note here is

489
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:20.319
Mark Pock:  he says, and thus objects, ie. Possible intuitions, must conform to concepts.

490
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:21.450
Mark Pock: Okay.

491
00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:26.670
Mark Pock: why are why are objects called possible intuitions?

492
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:40.170
Mark Pock: Khan is taking it as obvious to be an object is to be in to be intuitive on a sensuous level. Yes, it has content.

493
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:58.360
Mark Pock: Yep, that's a couple of consequences. That's what I'm saying that what Hegel is going to say is that that's one notion of an object. and that so count counts

494
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:04.810
Mark Pock: essentially an intuitionist. So he's saying that the criterion of objectivity is immediate

495
00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:09.469
Mark Pock: sensuous intuition. and because we cannot get that

496
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.030
Mark Pock: good because we cannot directly into it. Causality.

497
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:17.089
Mark Pock: it cannot be coming from the object.

498
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:25.710
Mark Pock: But the point is that causality is not sense sensuous. It doesn't mean it's not an object of experience.

499
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:34.920
Mark Pock: Okay, this is what Hegel is going to be getting at. Is that con saying.

500
00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.729
Mark Pock: Yeah, the subject over here with these concepts.

501
00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:41.810
Mark Pock: and then you have

502
00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:44.740
Mark Pock: the objects which is intuition.

503
00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:56.189
Mark Pock: And the thing is that I can Comp. There's there's double and triple ambiguities here because you have multiple objects. It turns out because you have

504
00:55:56.350 --> 00:56:04.769
Mark Pock: objects as possible intuitions. But that's actually not the object. Sorry objects turn out to be intuition that's structured by concepts.

505
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:15.790
Mark Pock: Okay? But the point is is that he can't really say that clearly because he thinks if it's going to be an object, it has to be immediately President, since it was intuition.

506
00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:18.260
Mark Pock: Yeah, we all just see it.

507
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:24.250
Mark Pock: And since you cannot see causality. it cannot be an object for

508
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:34.500
Mark Pock: because humid shown, it's not. But Hegel's point is this is the object.

509
00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:38.499
Mark Pock: These are objects. When you conceive of something.

510
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:39.670
Mark Pock: Hmm!

511
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:42.000
Mark Pock: It's an object for you.

512
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.289
Mark Pock: That's the whole of science, too. Again.

513
00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:51.819
Mark Pock: not what I'm saying, not for for cop. This, in some sense is not an object.

514
00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:58.259
Mark Pock: No, i' it's anything. You. Okay, this is, this is a key point. This is

515
00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:04.120
Mark Pock: I I know what cont is saying, Okay, but we have to think through what is actually saying and and

516
00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:07.240
Mark Pock: and take a step back. He's saying the reason why.

517
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:13.559
Mark Pock:  we cannot say that causality

518
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:20.229
Mark Pock: is a characteristic of the thing in itself is because I can't see it.

519
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:29.179
Mark Pock: Yes, which is to say, because only that which is sensible is objective.

520
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.340
Mark Pock: Okay?

521
00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:40.880
Mark Pock: Sure. Okay. And he was also in the yeah. Exactly so. But what Hegel is saying is that that's according to the one viewpoint of an object.

522
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:44.020
Mark Pock: objects. concepts, or objects

523
00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:51.720
Mark Pock: right

524
00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:58.450
Mark Pock: in that.

525
00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:09.800
Mark Pock: So the concept, the object is concept that brings people together. So that this is

526
00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.130
Mark Pock: something

527
00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.510
Mark Pock: is that that's appearance.

528
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:26.129
Mark Pock: That's it. But it's not

529
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:50.390
Mark Pock: an epistemological boundary that says all we can see of the appearance, all we can sense, the appearances in what field our concepts are those appearance and what they, whether they are not in the things beyond those appearances, we just don't know. No. But why? Why is this the object. This, this conjunction of concepts and intuition

530
00:58:52.160 --> 00:59:04.770
Mark Pock: that you're saying now is the object. This Con. Remember, just said that objects are possible intuition. He didn't say, this is the. It's the concept controlling the intuition.

531
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.760
Mark Pock: No, I understand that they are objects.

532
00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:20.459
Mark Pock: their objects. So. But now you. Now we're saying that that's what concept. Intuitions are our intuitions are objects are possible intuitions. You just said that. Now what I'm saying is, I understand there's a there there's there's more than one notion of objecting.

533
00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:22.560
Mark Pock: Okay, and so

534
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:23.880
Mark Pock: and

535
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:29.160
Mark Pock: why is the the union now of concept and intuition? Not an object?

536
00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:33.580
Mark Pock: Okay.

537
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:42.239
Mark Pock: why is this? Why is this not a thing in itself? Why is this not the thing in itself? Okay? Because it is not

538
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:48.190
Mark Pock: because we're talking to some logic.

539
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:56.229
Mark Pock: He's 6. And he says it's that one. So is not that.

540
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:59.800
Mark Pock: It's because that's the most we can

541
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:05.100
Mark Pock: conceptualize and proceed is that

542
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:15.840
Mark Pock: that's mostly

543
01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:23.259
Mark Pock: you just rest of the problem. Why is that okay? That your

544
01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:39.220
Mark Pock: as an object? No, I'm asking, why is it not the thing in it? Sense from Zoom. I'm not referred to as a thing that's all been asking, why is it not the thing? It's all does not refer to that. So I signed up that I'm saying, why is it not? Why does he not refer to it as a thing itself?

545
01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:46.260
Mark Pock: Because he is in this understanding to me, on this communication. all right, like

546
01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:51.629
Mark Pock:  between what is meant by the thing itself

547
01:00:52.450 --> 01:01:01.030
Mark Pock: as you're you're saying, why couldn't it be the concept? And I'm saying, because contact us that way.

548
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:13.999
Mark Pock: that's not an answer, because I'm telling. That's not an answer. Because you're saying, Okay, why doesn't I'm asking why? Doesn't need you with that, and I'll I'll I'll I'll cut the long story short because we continue this on. I'll tell you what Hegel says. Okay, Hegel is saying that

549
01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:19.460
Mark Pock: the problem here is that comp is in the viewpoint of sense certainty which we'll talk about.

550
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:23.859
Mark Pock: Okay. And he thinks that in order for something to be an object.

551
01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.240
Mark Pock: it must be sensible.

552
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:34.659
Mark Pock: Yeah. And since it can't be sent causality. it cannot be an object. It cannot come from the object

553
01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:39.780
Mark Pock: it has to come from in here in the subject.

554
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:46.209
Mark Pock: Hegel's point is that concepts or objects. we conceive them.

555
01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:54.310
Mark Pock: This is a basic thing this is. And then you get into the basic phenomenology of yes, there's an oasis in the Olymp okay.

556
01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:58.730
Mark Pock: the oasis is conceiving right

557
01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:03.400
Mark Pock: the act and then they can see the contact

558
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:13.910
Mark Pock: that's the object that's  that's the whole of scientific reality

559
01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.369
Mark Pock: cannot be sensed.

560
01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.140
Mark Pock: Since intuition

561
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:22.349
Mark Pock: is merely matters.

562
01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:29.589
Mark Pock: it's being being actualized, not standing over against some concept

563
01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.739
Mark Pock: concept itself. it emerges out of the matter

564
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:43.540
Mark Pock:  and the

565
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:46.530
okay.

566
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:59.199
Mark Pock: okay, and what I'm saying, okay, what? What? Hegel is saying is that concepts so that's a famous thing concepts without intuitions are empty. So concepts without intuitions. They're empty.

567
01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:00.330
Mark Pock: Which is

568
01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:04.259
Mark Pock: he, the point he's trying to make there is that

569
01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:14.570
Mark Pock: you can't use concepts like causality with respect to something like free will, because you don't ex. There's no, there's no intuition of that.

570
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:30.880
Mark Pock: Okay. And so it's illicit to. And like, for instance, like talking about God as the first cause. because there's no sensible intuition. So and that's why we run into problems philosophically, we use these concepts with without granting this is supposed to empiricism of Con, we have to ground our concepts

571
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:50.359
Mark Pock: in sensuous intuition. And then intuitions without concepts are blind. That is, they don't. It's just data coming at us, which is what you was saying. Look, you can't even have these intuitions without the concepts there. In the first place. Okay, this is Kayle saying something completely different. So this is this is huge. Okay, he's saying.

572
01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:53.950
Mark Pock: concepts are their own content.

573
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.280
Mark Pock: Concepts are contents

574
01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:03.579
Mark Pock: of no, that's but that's not what it says. No, I'm saying, yeah. So con concepts are contents.

575
01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:07.770
Mark Pock: Yes, yes, okay.

576
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:16.480
Mark Pock: so and that. And the reason why Con Cont doesn't have that. He thinks that the content of concepts as intuition.

577
01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.149
Mark Pock: What Hegel is saying is concepts on the content of acts of conceiving.

578
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:23.070
Mark Pock: Okay?

579
01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:30.330
Mark Pock: So

580
01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:34.020
Mark Pock: no.

581
01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.940
Mark Pock:  okay, so

582
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:55.360
Mark Pock: well, okay, we didn't actually get to 84. But I think we got the point about this whole idea of criterion. The one thing that I wanted to add, though. And then we will. we'll at least start a little bit of sense certainty.

583
01:04:55.490 --> 01:05:06.170
Mark Pock:  So I mean that all that is all important, that that is fun, fundamental. Okay, like, this is a problem

584
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:09.320
Mark Pock: that I mean, it's not

585
01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:21.600
Mark Pock: just even like whole philosophy departments are missing this. Okay, that this, that?  yeah, and how. And not understanding that.

586
01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:30.539
Mark Pock: like people just think concepts like it's called the substantive model of concepts substantive. So you concept of zoom things underneath them.

587
01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:33.850
Mark Pock:  and that's their content

588
01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:36.889
Mark Pock: and not differentiating. No.

589
01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:49.899
Mark Pock: this is, it's just not attending, not being able to differentiate the actual act. I I'm trying to tell you guys. there's the phenomenology of acts. It doesn't happen

590
01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:54.389
Mark Pock: like I was. I actually pulled up this book. It's doesn't matter. But, like.

591
01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.250
Mark Pock: here's this guy I heard about his name, Jason Stanley. I was going to talk because I

592
01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:03.040
Mark Pock: I can't encounter them in another context, for I can become pissed all these standard kind of analytic

593
01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:06.250
Mark Pock: stuff. And

594
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:14.399
Mark Pock: hey, they talk about justified. True of the completely right? Police believe you guys familiar with this believe, believe, like, how do we justify our beliefs?

595
01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:15.739
Mark Pock: And that's knowledge?

596
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:18.530
Mark Pock: Okay? But what's the belief?

597
01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:29.169
Mark Pock: Is it the act of believing. or is it the thing believed? And you have to. It's both okay. You have to distinguish, but they don't. There's just like belief.

598
01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:42.039
Mark Pock: And then they go. We're off and running about. Okay, what are the conditions that I can trust my beliefs without even doing a basic phenomenology, different, differentiating, believing from the believed as just a first thing to do.

599
01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.849
Mark Pock: And that's happening.

600
01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:51.790
Mark Pock: Okay? And people run with Compton, they think they're doing this. And it's it's missing a fundamental thing. Okay, anyway.

602
01:06:56.730 --> 01:07:01.469
Mark Pock: sorry. Anyway, what I got distracted on something. So so

603
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:05.319
Mark Pock: one last thing, this is this is going to 85

604
01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:10.549
Mark Pock: bottom of 80. The paragraph 85 on page 54.

605
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:20.080
Mark Pock: Yeah, we because we need to get into since certainty. But we'll we maybe come back to that later.  

606
01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:36.889
Mark Pock:  Yeah. Okay, so, but this distinction between the in itself and knowledge. So this is about halfway down two-thirds of the way down the page.

607
01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:43.760
Mark Pock: But this distinction between the in itself and knowledge is already present in the very fact that consciousness knows an object at all.

608
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:55.460
Mark Pock: something is for it in itself and knowledge, or the being of the object for consciousness is for it another moment, right? So for for consciousness. At this stage

609
01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:58.389
Mark Pock: the in itself is something different.

610
01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:06.810
Mark Pock: Oh. about 2 thirds of the way down. Paragraph 84. First time in the video.

611
01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:09.009
Mark Pock: Oh, is that different?

612
01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:12.990
Mark Pock: Upon this distinction.

613
01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.220
Mark Pock: which is present as a fact, the examination rests.

614
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:27.690
Mark Pock: If the comparison shows that these 2 moments do not correspond to one another, it would seem that consciousness must alter its knowledge to make it conform to the object.

615
01:08:27.819 --> 01:08:30.300
Mark Pock: So you change?

616
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:38.439
Mark Pock:  yeah, you you alter what you think, you know in order to, because, of course, the problem there is like, Okay, so if you already have the object

617
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:53.440
Mark Pock: you're now, you're gonna alter your knowledge to conform to it. But of course, if you have the object already. What are you conforming it to?  But, in fact, and the alteration of knowledge, the object itself

618
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:55.310
Mark Pock: alters for in 2,

619
01:08:55.830 --> 01:09:00.209
Mark Pock: for the knowledge that was present essentially was essentially a knowledge of that object.

620
01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:12.669
Mark Pock: As the knowledge changes so to does the object. for it initially belong to this knowledge. Hence it comes to pass for consciousness that what it previously took to be the in itself is not, and in itself.

621
01:09:13.529 --> 01:09:18.200
Mark Pock: that is to say, what previously thought. The object was what was given. Intuition

622
01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.820
Mark Pock: turns out not to be that that's not what an object is

623
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:31.319
Mark Pock: or that it was only and in itself for consciousness, since consciousness thus finds that. And that's what Cont concludes. Of course.

624
01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:41.870
Mark Pock: since consciousness does find that it's knowledge does not correspond to its object, the object itself does not stand the test. In other words, the criterion for testing is itself altered

625
01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:43.720
Mark Pock: when that for which it has been

626
01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:54.149
Mark Pock: the criterion fails to pass the test. And the testing is not only the testing of what we know, but also a testing of the criterion of what knowing is okay. So the criterion of a knowledge itself changes

627
01:09:55.530 --> 01:09:56.580
Mark Pock: as

628
01:09:57.030 --> 01:10:08.580
Mark Pock:  The object fails to correspond to the the criterion it initially set out, which is to say, as consciousness learns it can't experience

629
01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:11.359
Mark Pock: causality and sensation.

630
01:10:15.930 --> 01:10:20.510
Mark Pock: And the point is is not to say that okay, therefore calls out they can't be known.

631
01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:27.879
Mark Pock: or is not in itself. But it's to change your criterion of what knowing is the honest uncertainty?

632
01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:42.459
Mark Pock:  And but that's that's It's one thing that's adding to this whole thing of the correct, the criterion blah, blah blah! And the criterion is that the criterion? It's not there. There's not just one criterion.

633
01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:51.100
Mark Pock: The criterion itself develops over time. which is to say, another way of thinking about this is the very meaning of object

634
01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:53.400
Mark Pock: changes.

635
01:10:53.740 --> 01:11:00.240
Mark Pock: This is one way for science people. You can. This is this is what Kun got into. What Kun realized. Is that

636
01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:11.439
Mark Pock: what was an object for Einstein was not what an object was from me not. They're not the same. And by object, remember, we're talking about

637
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:13.910
Mark Pock: be what is objective

638
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:16.760
Mark Pock: and what

639
01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:22.600
Mark Pock: what reality consisted in for Newton. It's not where consistent. The object changes.

640
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:28.889
Mark Pock: and part of what happens is that because science changes. it starts to.

641
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:31.909
Mark Pock: it develops different criteria

642
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:33.480
Mark Pock: for itself.

643
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:40.859
Mark Pock: Of course you go. You can perceive that, of course, the objective world for pre-scientific things, where in which things like

644
01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:49.419
Mark Pock:  was a reality in which the flight of birds had some kind of objective meaning

645
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:52.590
Mark Pock: in terms of cause, Alan, for example.

646
01:11:54.150 --> 01:12:00.619
Mark Pock: and and fact. Tom will say, this is another critique for Kant, in a way, is that causality.

647
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:02.299
Mark Pock: Didn't you exist

648
01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:08.829
Mark Pock: for long, a long time in human consciousness? They did not understand causality. So like.

649
01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.279
Mark Pock: it wasn't an object

650
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:18.059
Mark Pock: like we don't. Just. It's like, Oh, yeah, one thing causes another. Tell that to a one-year-old

651
01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:45.789
Mark Pock:  And so okay, does that make some sense? This idea that it's actually even more complicated that the criterion, because this is the thing. Yes, of course, at the end we know there's like the criterion of criteria, criteria and criteria in some sense. But what we witness is that coming to be? That is

652
01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:50.409
Mark Pock: the the very nature of the criteria, and shifting as it tests itself.

653
01:12:50.730 --> 01:13:00.219
Mark Pock: And like, I said, I think you can verify that in the history of science, the very criteria by which we set up to judge knowledge, and the object itself thus changes

654
01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:05.800
Mark Pock: the world in which we live. As Cocoon says, scientists live in a different world now

655
01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:08.880
Mark Pock: they live in a different world. It's not the same world.

656
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:13.449
Mark Pock: Say, well, there's always this one world. Then you're taking the of you from nowhere.

657
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:22.559
Mark Pock: You're taking the view from nowhere. It's like, Oh, I can judge this is this have been the real world all along with. Guess what it's subject to change

658
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:25.290
Mark Pock: one to 2 about.

659
01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:39.649
Mark Pock: we're talking about a class with some results, because it's like you got the you love with I because it's good, like we're so much. You skip the hang of results in my seat. Everyone.

660
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:42.760
Mark Pock: the object of ethical action.

661
01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:55.309
Mark Pock: kind of changes in the equipment, and we cannot go back. We cannot even conceive of what it would be to be a Roman right?

662
01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:02.029
Mark Pock: But then you could sort of go to find that direction to be a Christian fundamentalist and then take the view from nowhere.

663
01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.550
Mark Pock: Because what? Okay? Here's one other thing that happens. I I should note this. this is.

664
01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:15.769
Mark Pock: this is a major interest in mine, because in the collected in the Scholarship. I don't. I don't. Okay. But I think I can.

665
01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:21.479
Mark Pock: One thing that happens. Okay, as as you send to these different viewpoints, we haven't again really gotten this number.

666
01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:34.020
Mark Pock: But this gets to your point directly to your point is that there's this thing, and trust me, it's there you can look at it and says it many, many times in the phenomenology it's very rarely revoked upon, although indirectly forget it.

667
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:35.560
That yes.

668
01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:39.110
Mark Pock: okay, what happens is, consciousness

669
01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:40.260
Mark Pock: develops.

670
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:47.350
Mark Pock: and as it changes the criterion, it posits a new object, because the object is relative to the criterion.

671
01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:52.690
Mark Pock: but it forgets that it does that, and so it treats the object as just there

672
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:56.340
Mark Pock: as having always been true.

673
01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:07.319
Mark Pock:  In fact, you can go back to talked about even pretty Christian sort of religions he talks about in ticket, he says to crayon

674
01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.730
Mark Pock: to.

675
01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:15.910
Mark Pock: is in the process of moving to a new criterion from the old myths to the kind of rational city of the Greek city state.

676
01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:18.430
Mark Pock: and and and he says

677
01:15:18.570 --> 01:15:20.900
Mark Pock: we don't know where these laws come from.

678
01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:25.230
Mark Pock: We just know the gods gave them to us, and they've always been there. They always will be.

679
01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.250
Mark Pock: and

680
01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:30.810
Mark Pock: and it would say, No, these these are totally contingent

681
01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.640
Mark Pock: historical realities.

682
01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:38.399
Mark Pock:  But spirit has forgotten its own process of positing its world.

683
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:40.649
Mark Pock: And so, yes, you can. Then.

684
01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.700
Mark Pock: yeah, most fundamentalisms are just radical forgettings.

685
01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:49.379
Mark Pock: Yeah, absolutely. I mean.

686
01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.159
Mark Pock: yeah, that's probably true for a lot of Islam.

687
01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:57.790
Mark Pock: like the whole history of Islam, the contingencies that were involved that's denied by orthodox

688
01:15:58.870 --> 01:16:02.179
Mark Pock: Muslims. This came directly from got to

689
01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:07.060
Mark Pock: to say, I don't know. If you guys know this, this came directly from God. It wasn't like

690
01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:09.979
Mark Pock: there. There wasn't like an influence from like

691
01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:18.019
Mark Pock: Judaism or Christianity. This is out in the desert came directly from God, and that's that's an orthodox belief.

692
01:16:18.650 --> 01:16:21.279
Mark Pock: Now I won't go into the history of whether how

693
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.960
Mark Pock: subtle that can get and how That's been reinterpreted. I'm fine to.

694
01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:36.420
Mark Pock: but there is certain orthodox fundamentalist strands in parts of Islam that say, you know this is direct revelation without any history that any context.

695
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:47.350
Mark Pock: Sure, yeah, I mean, it depends on the the strain. Of course, the the the tradition. But yeah, absolutely. There's there's fundamentalisms

696
01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:55.249
Mark Pock: all around. And I think you could classify that. What makes Hegel interesting. It's the same with property. Right? You take property. It's just given

697
01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.310
Mark Pock: without remembering

698
01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:00.250
Mark Pock: the history of conquest.

699
01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:15.590
Mark Pock: I don't know. I don't know, that's I. I I'm not a scholars, so I I

700
01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:21.670
Mark Pock: I I don't want to go too far in that direction. Yeah, yeah.

701
01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:31.709
Mark Pock: like. And I'm more than happy to be corrected on that. And you know, but I I think that I think we can say pretty safely. There are fundamentalists in Islam.

702
01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.970
Mark Pock: and they're not

703
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:44.490
Mark Pock:  They're not like, not as they're they're they're Muslim people, you know, just as they're fundamentalist evangelical Christians. I mean, that's just. And so what? Hey? Gold says, yeah, yeah.

704
01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.729
Mark Pock: you can start explaining

705
01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:52.280
Mark Pock: why we have fundamentalisms. Libertarianism is basically a fundamental lesson

706
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:58.220
Mark Pock:  and

707
01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:04.199
Mark Pock: it has to do with this process of forgetting because it treats me. But this can happen at any given instance, right?

708
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:07.759
Mark Pock: in all manner of context, like,

709
01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:15.910
Mark Pock: yeah, like Kant, I mean, Con comes on. This is the, you know, Tony, object as just the object.

710
01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:20.430
Mark Pock: And

711
01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:31.260
Mark Pock: and for Con, that's a problem. Because we've gone past this categories in science way, past his notion of space and time causality even

712
01:18:32.190 --> 01:18:36.110
Mark Pock: for him. It was definitive. The revelation came from Newton.

713
01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:42.970
Mark Pock: In fact, there's a poem by Pope. It says once they're

714
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:47.719
Mark Pock: was darkness, and God said, Let there be Newton, and all those light

715
01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:53.830
Mark Pock: that was the Enlightenment view then, once it was darkness. Now we step into a brave light.

716
01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:56.800
Mark Pock: and history is over.

717
01:18:56.930 --> 01:19:09.290
Mark Pock: Of course Hegel famously on that, really, because, of course, we know Hegel is going to say, then this is the real real end. But that's fine fine. We can critique. He go on healing grounds or post healing grounds.

718
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:18.220
Mark Pock:  but hopefully we can generate a lesson still that like this is a radical change in the way we're looking at history, and how

719
01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:20.970
Mark Pock: these ideas of merge. Yeah.

720
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:55.579
Mark Pock: But in that sense, so for the ph phenomenon logical observer that I guess cable would see it as like purely in the history as having this true view from nowhere. Right? But if we want to do the kind of first Italian thing and say that we're still in development. And we're just right. Right? Very good clients. Why, why do we remember? Why do we remember what we forgot what to remember the history. Yeah.

721
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.060
Mark Pock: Well.

723
01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:05.240
Mark Pock: I guess I guess one

724
01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:13.450
Mark Pock: part of what I guess we're headed on might start to respond to be something like, well, it's just a matter of fact. This is this is what conditioned our present view.

725
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:25.010
Mark Pock: And if we want to that cause, this kind of claim is that we can't. You can't understand these views unless you understand their history. That in which you say you can't. I'm not ultimately talking about these as sort of

726
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:31.919
Mark Pock: expressing philosophies. You can't really critique them, understand them, and therefore critique them adequately

727
01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.170
Mark Pock: unless you can explain how they emerged. Oh.

728
01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:43.790
Mark Pock: so. But again. It's also about self-knowledge. Because of this. Is the mind coming to know itself.

729
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.170
Mark Pock: we can't really know ourselves fully unless we understand our

730
01:20:48.580 --> 01:21:04.250
Mark Pock: The conditions of our emergency history. Now we have a problem here because Hegel is very selective in the history. Okay? And that that that might be a problem, because but it may also be something you can sort of negotiate

731
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:06.010
Mark Pock: by saying, Well.

732
01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:10.110
Mark Pock: we really need to focus, because Hegel has a sense

733
01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:12.260
Mark Pock: of like

734
01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:16.330
Mark Pock: community, and like. No one person can do this

735
01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:27.329
Mark Pock: and that knowledge is carried forward in the group. And so these these recollections we do. we have to. We we require other people to do them. We can't do them all at once.

736
01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:30.709
Mark Pock: I don't know if that is your question.

737
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:37.920
Mark Pock: yeah. Or I guess in a certain sense, too. Just like, why we reach the form of mind what we're able to even do.

738
01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:57.909
Mark Pock: Yeah. I'll keep going. Keep going for yes. Why? Why can it? So this is, yeah, definitely necessary to understand what's come before? Yeah. But it seems like whatever immediately preceded us, assuming that we're just kind of at the top of the food chair. Yeah, it failed it. It's like, yes, the radical break that allows us to be so fundamentally different in attaining the capacity of community. And for

739
01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:07.179
Mark Pock: is it something special about? Well, that's just that's the problem with criterion, like, you know, like he goes to say it self validating. We can. We now see that we're at the end.

740
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:16.059
Mark Pock: that we're at the end, or that we've come to this culminating point in in the history of self knowledge.

741
01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:19.569
Mark Pock: and I'm fully comfortable with

742
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:22.620
Mark Pock: just to that with from hang on

743
01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:30.649
Mark Pock:  But then we then we're almost thrown back into this continual challenge. Okay, is there?

744
01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:41.950
Mark Pock: Does that?  Because, like, yeah. she coon talks about. You know. you can't really say this is going anywhere.

745
01:22:42.710 --> 01:22:50.999
Mark Pock: And he talks about evolution as just like, well, it's a process that happens. And it's unfolding over time. Yes, this helps us understand. It's an analogy

746
01:22:51.080 --> 01:23:07.900
Mark Pock: like you can understand biological species, the understanding of history. But we're certainly not the end of it. But we do have it now. and it does help us understand this where we are now. and maybe it does help us. That's another thing is like, can we use this? Because, of course, Marx comes right along, and he says the point of

747
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:13.449
Mark Pock: philosophers spent their time trying to understand the world. The point of was to change it.

748
01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:15.870
Mark Pock: And so can we.

749
01:23:16.170 --> 01:23:19.399
Mark Pock: Can we?

750
01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:30.599
Mark Pock: Because you came? You were looking for the you really the funnel at home? Server?

751
01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.410
Mark Pock: so.

752
01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:39.000
Mark Pock: And and you know you could, you can say, no, we're actually going to integrate this into a of revolutionary

753
01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:43.409
Mark Pock: liberate laboratory movement that is ongoing.

754
01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:48.600
Mark Pock: I think it.

755
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:59.089
Mark Pock: it seems in this, but he developed to philosophy, noting that we that he on the subject

756
01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:03.460
Mark Pock: is, is imminent, imminently connect

757
01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:16.450
Mark Pock: to the and the object is the world ultimately, and that to consciousness and the relationship between consciousness to other consciousness of the people

758
01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:20.720
Mark Pock: and self-consciousness the Master slain.

759
01:24:21.630 --> 01:24:28.939
Mark Pock:  it's also part of that. We're all in this together, and he develops it.

760
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:30.160
Mark Pock: The philosophy

761
01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:36.910
Mark Pock: to note that this is a communal. we're we're operating.

762
01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.410
Mark Pock: It is a collective to sign.

763
01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:46.920
Mark Pock: which I think was tremendously. And yeah.

764
01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:52.689
Mark Pock: yeah, so I don't know. Did that to your question.

765
01:24:52.920 --> 01:25:05.090
Mark Pock: Yeah, I think that's at least in but just follow up second. was there a concern like what?

766
01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.040
Mark Pock: we might be able to be a problem

767
01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:24.480
Mark Pock: with with Hegel at this point, or something like that. Yeah. Or I guess it was just like the wise man problem with, like, How do we get out? Why is this special? Yeah. And I, I. It probably does go back to the problem criterion, like.

768
01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:32.629
Mark Pock: it was just going to say you have to go through it. We haven't started. and

769
01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:37.000
Mark Pock: if you all along

770
01:25:38.190 --> 01:25:39.069
Mark Pock: you'll see it.

771
01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:49.670
Mark Pock: But yeah, I mean, that's true like it's it's always yeah like you, said the the wise mentioned. I was like, I need to be wise in order to find the wise man I'm like.

772
01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:59.809
Mark Pock: I haven't yet to find one. So how do I? Where are these wise? And you guys are talking about? Yeah, why do we have this special here, I mean

773
01:26:01.670 --> 01:26:04.220
Mark Pock: I have a question

774
01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:11.220
Mark Pock: which one?

775
01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:14.820
Mark Pock: So again. So what's how to do with what?

776
01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:19.100
Mark Pock: The first she mentioned?

777
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:26.500
Mark Pock: If I home.

778
01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.240
Mark Pock: there's a whole thing, I thought, when you design.

779
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:37.670
Mark Pock: there's 2 words that get translated as experience in a term, one is a

780
01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:41.210
Mark Pock: and what is it? A thought one. And

781
01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:47.710
Mark Pock: Hegel was using a a far from here deliberately, because I

782
01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:58.339
Mark Pock: like what we would think of like experience as like what we experience like. So a sensation, whereas I have for him is an undergoing cause for him

783
01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:09.940
Mark Pock: is to travel. So if following is a kind of experience like you go. I'm going to have an experience when I go travel right. anyway. Keep continue. Please

784
01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:22.459
Mark Pock: wait. What we wait. Keep key. What? What? What passage is this.

785
01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:25.909
Mark Pock: and what part of it

786
01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:31.709
Mark Pock: at the end? Missions at the beginning.

787
01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:42.989
Mark Pock: the experience, the dialectical movement which consciousness exercises on itself.

788
01:27:43.290 --> 01:27:44.160
Mark Pock: the

789
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:50.430
Mark Pock: criterion, and therefore the object changing over time. Pickled calls. That's experience, that's experience.

790
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:55.829
Mark Pock: For some people. Experience is just what Hume says. It's just sense that a

791
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:59.040
Mark Pock: and then

792
01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:04.059
Mark Pock: and this is the true for being, for consciousness of this. And so.

793
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:13.959
Mark Pock: oh, yeah, okay, that that that has to do with the the fact that

794
01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:19.619
Mark Pock: there's a negation here. Okay, so the

795
01:28:20.730 --> 01:28:25.329
Mark Pock: what you thought was in the object is no longer the object.

796
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:28.340
Mark Pock: Okay? What you thought was being

797
01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:31.140
Mark Pock:  isn't.

798
01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:43.269
Mark Pock: So there's something. The but what Hegel is saying is, this gets into something we I skipped over. but he talked about. There's a kind of skeptical moment which is pure

799
01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:57.349
Mark Pock: annihilation is to say. therefore, nothing can be no, because we just got rid of this criterion by which we would presume to know anything. And now we realize that that criterion was inadequate because the object was inadequate

800
01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.090
Mark Pock: to the criterion

801
01:28:59.550 --> 01:29:03.500
Mark Pock: and last week, so like

802
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:14.060
Mark Pock:  in some sense, cont is part of that, too, because the the the object has now been band. The cause for Hegel, the object is the absolute.

803
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:20.160
Mark Pock: Okay. What is apps? The ultimately we, we have to introduce this term absolute. The thing that is.

804
01:29:21.190 --> 01:29:22.470
Mark Pock: I think, that really is.

805
01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:28.730
Mark Pock: And but if you find that that's not what it is absolute, what you took as the object is not absolute.

806
01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:35.360
Mark Pock: then it starts to be looked like nothing. It wasn't anything. But what Hegel was saying is that

807
01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:42.349
Mark Pock: no, it's we will build upon what appeared to be a loss. It turns out to be

808
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:52.809
Mark Pock: It's setting up something that we will become the new object. So out of this nothing is what it's the ultimate nothing. It's the. The appearance of nothing is to this form of consciousness.

809
01:29:54.410 --> 01:29:58.880
Mark Pock: So it's the indication of the negation. It's like it's the

810
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:04.950
Mark Pock: because, remember, you have to try to keep track of yourself all along that

811
01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:12.909
Mark Pock: there's a difference between what the what each form of consciousness does for us and what it thinks it's doing.

812
01:30:14.770 --> 01:30:17.529
Mark Pock: and it thinks that it's. And I think that it's

813
01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:27.039
Mark Pock: There is nothing now which say, a version of that is, well, the Absolute is just gone. It's fled, it may. It's not present in experience.

814
01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:29.990
Mark Pock: We we could know it at some point, but it's gone.

815
01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:36.979
Mark Pock: But Hegel is actually going to say no, that that thing that is the the mere Newman on we're going to. We're going to build out of that

816
01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:38.940
Mark Pock: is

817
01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:59.610
Mark Pock: yeah, he says. But as a matter of fact, we have here the same situation as the one discussed in regards to the relation between our exposition and step the system. Yes, right? You're saying that in every case the result of an untrue mode of college, let's not be allowed to run away. It's an empty nothing.

818
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.789
Mark Pock: Yeah, I don't know if that I don't know. That makes sense. I mean, kind of general. Yeah.

819
01:31:04.690 --> 01:31:17.670
Mark Pock: So would that be in opposition to maybe you? How sorry I think this same, or how how search

820
01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:20.010
Mark Pock: in the sense that maybe

821
01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:39.739
Mark Pock: I haven't read no search. But maybe it's not worth it. It's it's not worth it, it's it's it's not worth it, it's it's it's it's it's not worth, it, it's it's it's it's, it's not worth it, it's it's, it's, it's it's not worth it, it's it's it's it's it's it's not, worth, it it's it's it's it's it's it's it's, it's it's not worth it. It's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it'

822
01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:43.050
Mark Pock: but maybe maybe nothing is.

823
01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:48.990
Mark Pock: Well, actually, maybe maybe there's someone. But it's it's like nothing. This is this thing which oncologically persists and

824
01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:54.509
Mark Pock: and all being. And so I guess it is kind of. particularly in the sense that

825
01:31:55.120 --> 01:32:01.240
Mark Pock: within all being is non-being. But maybe it's not dialectic, only it's motion.

826
01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:10.150
Mark Pock: There's maybe something there. Yeah, that'd be interesting, does it? Sort of address dialogical reason? Yeah. Well, he does. Well, of course, at the beginning of

827
01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:26.459
Mark Pock: being nothing else. But he also hasn't booked a dialectical reasoning or a reason. My critique of dialectical reason. No, I haven't read it. I I I need to read it. I'm lazy.

828
01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:30.120
Mark Pock: He was granted towards the end of his life to finish.

829
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:34.530
Mark Pock: and I tried to read it.

830
01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:39.620
Mark Pock: Some of it is somewhat accessible.

831
01:32:40.230 --> 01:32:45.490
Mark Pock: and then it became like.

832
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:54.789
Mark Pock: is that he was so frantic about trying to get this done before he died. They kept on taking tremendous

833
01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:02.559
Mark Pock: of I'm a of met, and he was like

834
01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:07.510
Mark Pock: completely wired. like 2020,

835
01:33:07.670 --> 01:33:19.160
Mark Pock: so we had to be. When he finished he sent it to a publisher, and such in the second giant that

836
01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:26.730
Mark Pock: nobody, no editor was going to critique it, criticize me, so they just let it go through on a

837
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:35.280
Mark Pock: and when you try to read it, it's a challenge, anyway. So yeah, we could

838
01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:40.969
Mark Pock: another reading group. Okay, so let's let's do like 10 min of

839
01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:43.990
Mark Pock: consciousness since certainty.

840
01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:46.900
Mark Pock: Okay.

841
01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:55.999
Mark Pock: so this is good. Yeah, this is, now we're gonna do the thing. so the knowledge or no one.

842
01:33:56.540 --> 01:34:07.360
Mark Pock: which is at the start, or is immediately our objects, cannot be anything else but immediate knowledge itself. A knowledge of the immediate. This is Paragraph 90.

843
01:34:08.130 --> 01:34:11.270
Mark Pock: This the beginning of since 1,958

844
01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:23.079
Mark Pock: Our approach to the object must also be immediate. Our approach to the object must also be immediate or receptive. We must all turn nothing in the object as it presents itself.

845
01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:26.109
Mark Pock: Okay. So of course, what he's saying, here is that

846
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:31.600
Mark Pock: you know this. This is all. This is always a problem. Where do we start? Okay.

847
01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:45.170
Mark Pock: And this is why Hegel writes to a preface in an introduction, basically saying, I don't know how to write it. And so it's like, Okay, we are going to start somewhere. And what Hegel appeals to here is like, Okay, what would seem to be otherwise? The

848
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:50.810
Mark Pock: what one might be most inclined to.

849
01:34:51.170 --> 01:35:03.419
Mark Pock: think, should one sort of unreflectively just say, Okay, what is what is. and try to describe that viewpoint.

850
01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.860
Mark Pock: Try to do a phenomenology of that, any point.

851
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:13.569
Mark Pock: And so, according to Hegel, he's saying. According to that view.

852
01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:20.829
Mark Pock: your your, your thing is just that there are things there, and I just

853
01:35:20.850 --> 01:35:22.050
Mark Pock: they just hit me.

854
01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:27.890
Mark Pock: and they just reveal themselves immediately to me. I don't do anything.

855
01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:39.140
Mark Pock:  Immediate or receptive, and apprehending it, you must reframe from trying to comprehend it.

856
01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:53.689
Mark Pock: Okay, now, why does it? Why do we do this? Well, because of its concrete content set certainty immediately appears as the richest kind of knowledge. Because it's just all there. Look, guys, look around. It's everything. Boom

857
01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:57.010
Mark Pock: being is just. and it's the richest

858
01:35:57.030 --> 01:36:12.570
Mark Pock: indeed the knowledge of infinite wealth for which no balance can be found, either when we reach out into space and time, and which is dispersed, or when we take a bit of this wealth and division into our and then enter into it. So just take your pick. You can just

859
01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.900
Mark Pock: look out. It's expansive things, or look at something. It's just all there. And all this richness.

860
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:33.950
Mark Pock: Moreover, it's uncertainty appears to be the truest knowledge. not just the richest, but the. for it has not yet not as yet omitted anything from the object. but as the object to forward and perfect, and it's perfect entirely there it is. Zoom being is just there.

861
01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:45.299
Mark Pock: and it's entirely. But in the event this very certainty proves itself to be the most abstract and the poorest truth. Oh, turns into it's opposite. Wouldn't you know?

862
01:36:45.570 --> 01:36:49.420
Mark Pock: All that it says about what it knows is just that it is.

863
01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:53.170
Mark Pock: that's all it can say. Well, what it what is.

864
01:36:53.490 --> 01:37:02.920
Mark Pock: whatever is, what is being that which is  and it's truth contains nothing but the sheer being of the thing.

865
01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.569
Mark Pock: consciousness for its part. So that's the object that it

866
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:10.880
Mark Pock: since certainty thinks it knows

867
01:37:12.050 --> 01:37:13.800
Mark Pock: it, thinks it knows the

868
01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:21.789
Mark Pock: the richest and truest object. We've just noticed that it's actually the poorest. We're gonna have to see how it is.

869
01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:26.860
Mark Pock: We'll watch, but we'll also watch how consciousness discovers this too.

870
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.449
Mark Pock: So consciousness, for its part, is in this certainty only as here as a pure I

871
01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:38.549
Mark Pock: or I am, and it's only as appear this.

872
01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:48.789
Mark Pock: and the objects similarly only appear. This I, this particular. I am certain of this particular thing, not because I quote consciousness, and knowing it, have to develop myself

873
01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.289
Mark Pock: or thought about it in various ways.

874
01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:56.530
Mark Pock: So again, we're back to development potency to act me thinking that

875
01:37:57.090 --> 01:37:59.400
Mark Pock: we think we know something

876
01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.159
Mark Pock: consciousness, things that that

878
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:13.049
Mark Pock: it, doesn't it? it just takes the thing like, because this is the thing it's like. It's the richest thing

879
01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:19.560
Mark Pock: like as if the world of the child, the one year old child is the richest thing. Now, of course, I love you little children. They're beautiful.

880
01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:33.739
Mark Pock: Yeah, okay, so okay, anyway, you guys go that round. But  Hegel will make the case. We live in a much richer.

881
01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:45.309
Mark Pock: Okay? And so, even though the whole world is apparently out there for the infants. On all its richness. It's actually very limited, confined, and not only just spatially and temporarily but

882
01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:48.819
Mark Pock: qualitatively, there's just less to the reality for the

883
01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:49.830
Mark Pock: okay.

885
01:38:55.830 --> 01:39:15.730
Mark Pock: not because we've developed ourselves or thought about in various ways, and also not because the thing of which I'm certain, in, in virtue of a host of distinct qualities. Again, that I would have thought through and developing would be in its own self a rich complex of connections, of course, ultimately will be. The totality of reality is a rich complex of connections for Hegel, or related in various ways to other things.

886
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:28.180
Mark Pock: Neither of these has anything to do with the truth of sense certainty here, neither. I know the thing has the significance of a complex process of mediation. The I does not have the significance of a manifold imagining or thinking?

887
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:41.360
Mark Pock: Or does the thing signify that? something that has a host of qualities. On the contrary, the thing is, and it is merely because it is. It is. This is the essential point for sense knowledge.

888
01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:46.090
Mark Pock: And this pure being. Now one thing to know okay, is that

889
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:52.739
Mark Pock: this gets to mark what you're saying, what we've been talking about, which is

890
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.029
Mark Pock: some sense

891
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:04.049
Mark Pock: I'm I'm getting way ahead of myself here, but in some sense

892
01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.320
Mark Pock: spirit is because it is

893
01:40:08.710 --> 01:40:11.860
Mark Pock: so, since certain team maybe not entirely wrong here.

894
01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:17.000
Mark Pock: But it it's it's doesn't quite understand what it's saying.

895
01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:21.690
Mark Pock: because it's it's has a sense of something self validating.

896
01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:31.249
Mark Pock: But it's the immediate. the Me. It is the problem. In some sense it's not so much that it's self validating, that they immediate. It's not self validating

897
01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:43.290
Mark Pock: would be the problem. But all along is this other thing happening where it is. cause it. But what's funny is it's self validating, but it's also it is because it is. It gives a reason.

898
01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:46.250
Mark Pock: But the only reason it can give is because

899
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:48.449
Mark Pock: it is

900
01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:55.949
Mark Pock:  Anyway, I hope that made a little bit of sense. There's something going on there.

901
01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:07.110
Mark Pock: if you wanted to go big, big. Well, okay, there's one slightly bigger. There's this particular person he's referring to here. His name is G. Shultz. I can tell you guys about him later. He's a transition point between

902
01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:11.450
Mark Pock:  can't

903
01:41:11.630 --> 01:41:14.280
Mark Pock: and and and he's right up to Ficta

904
01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:31.460
Mark Pock: into hang on. Okay? And it's a long thing. He was the this he was this moderate because he wass first work was Published work was a critique of modern skepticism in favor of ancient skepticism. It's called Sip skepticism. The skepticismous essay. And then he's particularly critical

905
01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:39.430
Mark Pock: of Ge. Schultz. But, gee! It's also a representative of the modern skepticism. Starting with Descartes, which is, how do I get outside of my head

906
01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:46.879
Mark Pock: to the thing. And what Schultz's solution was, don't worry about it. It is because it is okay. Just you just have the absolute.

907
01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:53.129
Mark Pock: Okay. Now, there's a bigger thing, even bigger, which is, do you guys know the tetragonal grammaton?

908
01:41:53.330 --> 01:42:20.099
Mark Pock: You do not. You know the pronunciation you can say to the name of God. Yeah, he's not supposed to say, though, yahweh, yeah. Oh, it's like tetragrammaton. Because I am that I am yeah, right? Right? Right?

909
01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.490
Mark Pock: Yeah, yeah, I am that I am, or

910
01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:25.300
Mark Pock: I am he who is. and

911
01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:33.310
Mark Pock: he on those he he's not getting. He's good theologian. Okay, this is all lurking in the background. Because cause cause? Moses asks.

912
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:38.009
Mark Pock: what is, how can you? How can you justify yourself to me because

913
01:42:38.130 --> 01:42:52.050
Mark Pock: he wants a he wants a reason he wants a criterion. and he says. I am because I am okay. But like, Okay, anyway, we'll get into all that kind of stuff that's lurking in the background. Similarly.

914
01:42:52.190 --> 01:42:56.750
Mark Pock: certainty as a connection is an immediate peer connection. Okay, that's the problem.

915
01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:10.499
Mark Pock: Consciousness is I nothing more appear. This, the singular consciousness knows up here this or the single item. Now we shifted a little bit. We've gone from the full richness of things to

916
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:16.020
Mark Pock: what? So this is the thing. Okay, this is this business. We go.

917
01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:19.860
Mark Pock: What? What is? What's this?

918
01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:24.460
Mark Pock: What's an object? It's this, you know, this, this, this.

919
01:43:25.050 --> 01:43:37.369
Mark Pock: this, this okay, which is what is a kind of a version of this immediately?  and so for for

920
01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:39.190
Mark Pock: for uncertainty.

921
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:49.769
Mark Pock: Yeah, I mean literally, in apprehending prehensile of pre prehending is to to grab as we talked about. Right? It's saying, well.

922
01:43:50.210 --> 01:43:52.710
Mark Pock: so whatever, it's just kind of this thing that is there.

923
01:43:53.260 --> 01:44:07.390
Mark Pock: Hegel famously says for Kant. A an object is a candle box. I don't know a snuff box and a candle, so that box here, candle there because cotton, it continues in this. He doesn't actually get past uncertainty, but we'll get into that later.

924
01:44:08.670 --> 01:44:12.600
Mark Pock: so the this. But when we look carefully at this pure being

925
01:44:12.690 --> 01:44:26.419
Mark Pock: which constitutes the essence of this on of a certainty, and which this certainty pronounces to be its truth. we see that much more is involved. An actual sense certain is not merely this pure immediately, but an instance of it.

926
01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:37.910
Mark Pock: Okay, this is, gonna be interesting. Among the countless differences cropping up here, we find in every case, that the crucial one is that, and sense certainty here being at once split up into what I have called to this is

927
01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:43.460
Mark Pock: this, as I and this and the other. This as object.

928
01:44:44.250 --> 01:44:57.139
Mark Pock: we, we, we when we reflex. So that's us. That's like phenomenal. When we reflect on this difference, we find that neither one or the other is only immediately present in sense certainty, but each is at the same time mediated.

929
01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:02.660
Mark Pock: I have this certainty through something else the thing. And similarly, it is sense certain to you

930
01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:07.599
Mark Pock: through something else, namely, through the I. Okay. So what he's saying is.

931
01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.069
Mark Pock: you say this is

932
01:45:12.190 --> 01:45:14.400
Mark Pock: but for I'm saying it.

933
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:25.530
Mark Pock: and so we would immediately have mediation immediately. I mean, you see, falls apart into an opposition

934
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:33.869
Mark Pock: on its own terms. What he's trying to say

935
01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:41.070
Mark Pock: yes, right? Because that's

936
01:45:42.850 --> 01:45:47.279
Mark Pock: I don't want to see this.

937
01:45:50.420 --> 01:46:00.070
Mark Pock:  you start up with the the knowledge of no, or knowing which. It is a concern that you immediately. Our object cannot think of.

938
01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:01.359
Mark Pock: So

939
01:46:01.370 --> 01:46:09.870
Mark Pock: we're talking about immediately, without anything coming in between crossing the object. It just right there.

940
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:15.580
Mark Pock: And so the question is, what do you refer to that?

941
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:16.780
Mark Pock: Yes.

942
01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:20.430
Mark Pock: and who's so? This already is cuts?

943
01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:24.000
Mark Pock: Well, we're not there yet. We're not there yet.

944
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:29.919
Mark Pock: It's it's it's already defined it to a certain extent.

945
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:41.830
Mark Pock: and it's not something that's immediate, be. It is already some particular thing as opposed to something other thing to this, and I

946
01:46:42.010 --> 01:46:45.410
Mark Pock: in a in in regard

947
01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:47.550
Mark Pock: that I am different from

948
01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:51.060
Mark Pock: that in.

949
01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:52.360
Mark Pock: So

950
01:46:52.510 --> 01:47:21.309
Mark Pock: they cut right away on its own terms. It's falling apart, this notion of immediacy. It's on the part, on its own terms. And that's what I think it means by the the observer is that this method just doesn't. We don't do anything to make this come about. It happens on. It's on the core, I guess, looking at it carefully, and we see them in false partners.

951
01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:30.479
Mark Pock:  it's the best use of time. Well, what do you think it? I just

952
01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:43.050
Mark Pock: that makes sense. I just. I'm wondering how much maybe we can push back on the idea that it does collapse on its own terms. Yeah. Like, for instance. why not like, why necessarily

953
01:47:43.060 --> 01:48:01.960
Mark Pock: does to this? Why does why do I appear to myself? Because from our, okay? Good, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. So so that's good. Because he he does say, when we reflect on this difference. So maybe we're already doing that thing like, like, why not have a world of Pre mirror stage?

954
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:12.809
Mark Pock: Well, okay, so let's see, let's see, because you may raised a good point there. Which is, have we really shown that this is what the the viewpoint is actually experiencing for itself?

955
01:48:13.170 --> 01:48:16.890
Mark Pock: That's good, because in some sense. So yeah, it's like

956
01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:22.989
Mark Pock: Hegel is saying, well. the viewpoint is just send this about itself.

957
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:27.760
Mark Pock: it said, the this is the thing that is there immediately for me.

958
01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:34.680
Mark Pock: Well, what does that mean? It means you just introduce mediation. He's adding that you're right.

959
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:50.189
Mark Pock: And so is that satisfying the viewpoint itself. No, not yet, because it doesn't have the capacity to rep to reflect on that very point. Yet that is to say, that it has introduced differentiation. It still thinks it's got the thing immediately.

960
01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:58.649
Mark Pock: Now we'll see. I I think Hegel is going to claim that eventually it starts to pick up on this, that this is what's happening.

961
01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:01.540
Mark Pock: Are you starting to get

962
01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:09.120
Mark Pock: in the the beginning of negation with that? But it doesn't.

963
01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:15.800
Mark Pock: it doesn't. And I it just

964
01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:23.589
Mark Pock: to the this.

965
01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:24.960
Mark Pock: it's concerned.

966
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:29.380
Mark Pock: But yeah, so like, you're right that

967
01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:35.130
Mark Pock: this is not exactly what the with the viewpoint, would say by itself. Right?

968
01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:42.610
Mark Pock: But Hegel saying, I'm just doing a phenomenology. Still, I'm just reading off what's going on there. I'm not added anything.

969
01:49:45.850 --> 01:49:49.630
Mark Pock: So you have to see. But let's keep going. Okay.

970
01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:56.870
Mark Pock:  It's not just that we

971
01:49:56.970 --> 01:50:06.020
Mark Pock: who make this distinction between essence in this instance, between the on the contrary, we find it is within, since certainty itself.

972
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:15.679
Mark Pock: and it is to be taken up in the form and which is present here, not as we have just to find it. Okay, so not as we just just find it. But it does make a distinction.

973
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:28.179
Mark Pock: One of the terms is positive, since certainty in the form of a simple, immediate being, or as the essence, the object. The other, however, is positive as what is on essential and mediated something which is.

974
01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:31.150
Mark Pock: which in the uncertainty, is not in itself.

975
01:50:32.250 --> 01:50:35.360
Mark Pock: but through the mediation of another, the I.

976
01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:48.120
Mark Pock: Okay. Because remember, okay, for one thing, let's just emphasize for set for consciousness. Well, because, by the way. I I mean, there's a lot of structural thing that he goes. Consciousness, self consciousness, reason. Okay, and then spirit. But through it is really just reason.

977
01:50:48.530 --> 01:51:00.349
Mark Pock:  So in when we go to, when we, we, we're starting in consciousness, it has 3 sections since certainty, perception. for an understanding, and then kind of a subsection on transition to to

978
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:04.920
Mark Pock: self-consciousness in consciousness the object is all important

979
01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:20.559
Mark Pock: and self-consciousness the self. The subjects becomes all important and then reasonable medium together. Okay, so we'll see. But even. But there's always circles within circles. So there's going to be a point in sense, certainty where it thinks the subject is most important, but it's always still kind of.

980
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.349
Mark Pock: or it out on the object. Because this is a media scene. This is

981
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:35.030
Mark Pock: pretty philosophical on reflective consciousness, trying to tell us about what reality is.  

982
01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:52.009
Mark Pock: the up. So for this consciousness the object is, it is what is true or the essence. It is regardless of whether it is known or not. That's a big thing, right? It's just out there, and it remains, even if it is not known, whereas there is no knowledge, if the object is not there.

983
01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:53.470
Mark Pock: the question

984
01:51:53.580 --> 01:52:01.720
Mark Pock: must therefore be considered whether, in sense, certainty itself, the object is, in fact, the kind of essence that's in certainty proclaims it to be

985
01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:15.560
Mark Pock: so. That's partially the answer to. I'm not dealt with your question. It does recognize some kind of difference, but it doesn't understand. It thinks it's just like there's this absoluteness. And then there's this kind of fleeting consciousness that may or may not be present to sense certainty.

986
01:52:15.630 --> 01:52:18.889
Mark Pock: But the object is the only thing it's claims to be worried about.

987
01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:24.939
Mark Pock: You see what I'm saying as opposed to like you've actually acknowledged. There's a fundamental mediation going on here.

988
01:52:25.710 --> 01:52:27.290
Mark Pock: But there's plenty more to be said.

989
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:46.489
Mark Pock: Okay, whether this notion of it as the essence corresponds to the objects. Okay, since sort of to this end we we have not to reflect on it and ponder what it might be in truth, but only consider the way in which it is present in sense certainty. Okay, here's here's and we'll we'll end here. This is a good, this is a good spot to end. It's it's a fun thing.

990
01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:52.589
Mark Pock:  It is then sent certainty itself that must be asked. This is good

991
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:54.329
Mark Pock: because we're kind of

992
01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:59.830
Mark Pock: creating a question of sensor and asking it to answer for itself. What is the this

993
01:53:00.910 --> 01:53:04.160
Mark Pock: if we take the this and the twofold shape

994
01:53:04.170 --> 01:53:06.769
Mark Pock: of its being as now, and as here

995
01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:12.710
Mark Pock: the dialectic in it that like has in it will receive a form

996
01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:17.979
Mark Pock: as intelligible as the this itself. To the question, What is now? Let us now

997
01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:25.849
Mark Pock: let us answer now is night. Okay? So we're saying, we're kind of saying, Well, what is it? This? What's this here? Now? This here? Now.

998
01:53:26.170 --> 01:53:28.540
Mark Pock: that's what it is. Okay, fine.

999
01:53:28.590 --> 01:53:29.660
Mark Pock: What is now

1000
01:53:30.710 --> 01:53:32.560
Mark Pock: let us answer, now is night.

1001
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:39.650
Mark Pock: In order to test the truth of this uncertainty, a simple experiment will suffice right down this truth.

1002
01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:43.130
Mark Pock: it's classic.

1003
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:51.230
Mark Pock: Any. A truth cannot lose anything by being written down, any more than it can lose anything through our preserving it. If now.

1004
01:53:51.420 --> 01:54:01.310
Mark Pock: if now this noon we look again. We will say that this has become stale. So what we thought was absolute this year. Now.

1005
01:54:02.370 --> 01:54:08.349
Mark Pock: okay, fine. What what is now. Well, now, it's 6 30.

1006
01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:10.269
Mark Pock: Okay, is that absolute?

1007
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:20.589
Mark Pock: just wait. Oh. and so then what he's gonna say, we can, we can stop here. But he's gonna say. you go through this things you realize like

1008
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:24.680
Mark Pock:  every

1009
01:54:24.930 --> 01:54:35.030
Mark Pock: you know, the now is constantly changing. But then you you get this point where you can see. Yeah, but in some sense there's an an eternal now. It's always now.

1010
01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:39.009
Mark Pock: And so in some sense the now is absolute, but not on the way immediately he thought of it

1011
01:54:39.690 --> 01:54:42.310
Mark Pock: has the now that is just day.

1012
01:54:43.810 --> 01:54:52.889
Mark Pock: and so there's a kind of a negation of the negation where he thought that now was just this, you know, 12 noon sunny outside

1013
01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:55.760
Mark Pock: turns out

1014
01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:00.630
Mark Pock: that now is also midnight. so that has been negated.

1015
01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:09.990
Mark Pock: But then you negate that negation. And you say, Well, yeah, in some sense, but that makes it a universal. The. It turns out that now is not immediate. It's mediated. It's universal.

1016
01:55:11.110 --> 01:55:14.300
Mark Pock: It's not a particular this. It's always now.

1017
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:18.610
Mark Pock:  yes, very good.

1018
01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:23.539
Mark Pock: And that will be the same for this, too, as we will see.

1019
01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:32.029
Mark Pock: because everything is as is this. So this, what? We're trying to say something individual, everything is, this is a universal.

1020
01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:44.630
Mark Pock: Yeah. I was just wondering about that. Yeah. Yeah. So yes, of course. Yeah, that's a problem. I that I think that's a

1021
01:55:47.770 --> 01:56:10.259
Mark Pock: yes, he is a little bit. He is okay. So so there's

1022
01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:16.420
Mark Pock:  At the same time, maybe there are ways to

1023
01:56:18.090 --> 01:56:21.270
Mark Pock: try to recover what he is actually saying, which is

1025
01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:41.370
Mark Pock: yeah, I mean, I guess he's kind of seeing what I already said, which is that I mean, we can almost dispose of this. I think that this is a problem because he doesn't. Yeah, it's a, it's a problem with, because you guys know what we're talking about like,

1026
01:56:42.190 --> 01:56:54.090
Mark Pock: demonstratives or or indicatives where you're in Texacles. Yeah, sorry. In Texas, where you're  You have universal notions like now.

1027
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:59.290
Mark Pock: But then you say this now as opposed to that now, and this is

1028
01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:08.059
Mark Pock: not being used as a universal. That's not the function it plays in the sentence. It's not a now title's treating it as it now.

1029
01:57:08.610 --> 01:57:12.249
Mark Pock: because in some sense you can use this as this. What's real this?

1030
01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:17.260
Mark Pock: But he's confused it. And he's thinking we're using it to be transformed.

1031
01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:19.850
Mark Pock: What is merely a demonstrative into a now.

1032
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:29.709
Mark Pock: and he's he's confusing something there. But  that's true. That's a kind of blunder on Hales part.

1033
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:36.959
Mark Pock:  but I suppose we can either. Just just kind of ignore that.

1034
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:43.580
Mark Pock: There is something that a little bit more there, because there is a way to back up

1035
01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:46.680
Mark Pock: and talk about.

1036
01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:51.840
Mark Pock: this gets while you'd have to start talking about Scotus.

1037
01:57:52.530 --> 01:57:54.240
Mark Pock: And this

1038
01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:59.679
Mark Pock: also known as Hitchhi Tos. It's the Latin.

1039
01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:01.450
Mark Pock: because

1040
01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:07.500
Mark Pock: this was a big problem of of solving the. It was the thirteenth century. It was called the Problem of the Universals.

1041
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:15.910
Mark Pock: where they couldn't figure out how universal. So then you ended up with Nominalism, so that universals are merely just words. They don't refer to anything in reality.

1042
01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:22.409
Mark Pock:  and Scotus tried to split the difference and say, there was this, this.

1043
01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:34.079
Mark Pock: that was a not a universal, because every you could say, Okay, what's it had to do with the problem of individual? What individuates? Because everything we used to describe something. All of its qualities are universal terms blue, red.

1044
01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:37.340
Mark Pock: and then but is there something in the thing that's just

1045
01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:40.290
Mark Pock: the this which makes it individual.

1046
01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:49.710
Mark Pock: this is part of what this has been remarkable, and I don't think it's been developed nearly enough. I don't think people will realize, because there is an issue with Echinstein and the

1047
01:58:49.900 --> 01:59:00.900
Mark Pock: a linguist confusion here. But I don't think it's merely that there's something else about how we're dealing with, because we're this is the whole thing, the universal in particular. That's a big thing, an ongoing thing. And

1048
01:59:01.330 --> 01:59:02.569
Mark Pock: how do we?

1049
01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:07.919
Mark Pock: Because the famous paradox is actually the er it's it's it's it's because sciences of the universal.

1050
01:59:09.450 --> 01:59:13.349
Mark Pock: There's no sign of the individual as individual. but everything is individual.

1051
01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:18.880
Mark Pock: Everything is particular. So either science. either reality is unknowable

1052
01:59:19.980 --> 01:59:30.049
Mark Pock: or science is not of reality. It's a that's a fundamental paradox aerosol does to confront because it has to do with what is the principle of individuation, and how do we know it?

1053
01:59:30.730 --> 01:59:32.810
Mark Pock: How do you know the individual as individual?

1054
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:37.360
Mark Pock: So that's part of what's going on here.

1055
01:59:37.570 --> 01:59:39.770
Mark Pock: And what he's kind of saying is that, well.

1056
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:50.449
Mark Pock: he's he's basically saying, Yeah, that the individual only exists through the universal or something like that it's kind of what he's getting at. I mean, it's I don't know. But

1057
01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:57.349
Mark Pock: if we want to just put that to the side, we can simply look at like the now on the here and say, like, Okay.

1058
01:59:57.790 --> 02:00:02.570
Mark Pock:  We thought that we thought the object was so this year now.

1059
02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:07.009
Mark Pock: but then, now it turns out to be not absolute in the way that we took it to me.

1060
02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:13.890
Mark Pock: It's actually constantly being negated, but it still preserves itself in that negation.

1061
02:00:15.050 --> 02:00:19.419
Mark Pock: But that's just the start. Okay? And what he was trying to say. Of course, the larger point is that

1062
02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:26.279
Mark Pock: being is not immediate, and our knowing of being is not immediate. So in our very knowing of it now, we're already

1063
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:28.760
Mark Pock: meeting it through a university

1064
02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:34.199
Mark Pock: that make make sense. Yeah.

1065
02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:36.169
Mark Pock: that's the direction.

1066
02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:44.549
Mark Pock: So good. Yeah, that's the direction we'll maybe we'll pick up. We keep going 7, 30, no finished and 30 tomorrow. That'd be good.

1067
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:51.960
Mark Pock: Your nation today. Yes.
