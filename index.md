Words of encouragement from Prof. Peters on the *Phenomenology of the Spirit*:

> It will likely read like gibberish. Yes, worse that Husserl. But, don't worry, Hegel ain't actually that hard. Seriously. Don't be intimidated. There's just a nest of terms that, as Lonergan and Hilbert would say, implicitly define one another that you have to a hold on and then the whole thing starts to open up.
