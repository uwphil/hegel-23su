## Readings
Links provided by Prof. Peters.
- [Lectures on the History of Philosophy](https://archive.org/details/lecturesonthehis01hegeuoft/page/n21/mode/2up){:target="_blank"}
- [*Phenomenology of the Spirit* (Findlay translation)](http://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Marxist_Philosophy/Hegel_and_Feuerbach_files/Hegel-Phenomenology-of-Spirit.pdf){:target="_blank"}

Words of encouragement from Prof. Peters on the *Phenomenology of the Spirit*:

> It will likely read like gibberish. Yes, worse that Husserl. But, don't worry, Hegel ain't actually that hard. Seriously. Don't be intimidated. There's just a nest of terms that, as Lonergan and Hilbert would say, implicitly define one another that you have to a hold on and then the whole thing starts to open up.
